title: Installation
---

For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using Flutter, we have the [web3auth-flutter-sdk](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk) to
integrate Web3Auth into your application.

**Requirements**

- Android API version 21 or newer.
- `compileSdkVersion` 32

---

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter: ^1.0.1
```

or

```sh
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/sdk/android#installation).
- For Android, the `redirectUrl` parameter is **specificable**, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/sdk/ios#installation).

- For iOS, the `redirectUrl` parameter is **fixed**, which is `\(bundleId)://auth`, and does not need to be added as a iOS Custom URL Scheme.
