This guide will cover the basics of how to use the Web3Auth Unity SDK in your preferred platform. Before starting you can try out the sample
application as mentioned in quick start.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd unity/unity-auth0-example
# Open in Unity Hub
```

## How it works?

---

When integrating Web3Auth Unity SDK with Social Login the flow looks something like this:

![Web3Auth Core - Social Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

- When a user logs in with a login provider like `Google`, it sends a JWT `id_token` to the app. This JWT token is sent to the Web3Auth SDK's login
  function.

- Finally, on successful validation of the JWT token, Web3Auth SDK will generate a private key for the user, in a self custodial way, resulting in
  easy onboarding for your user to the application.

## Prerequisites

---

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- Unity Editor 2019.4.9f1 or greater

- .Net Framework 4.x

<Auth0Prerequisites />

## Setup

---

### Setup your Auth0 Tenant

<Auth0Setup />

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

### Create Auth0 Verifiers

<Auth0VerifierSetup />

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

---

To use the Web3Auth SDK, you need to add the dependency of the respective platform SDK of Web3Auth to your project. To know more about the available
SDKs, please have a look at this [documentation page](/sdk).

For this guide here, we will be talking through the [Web3Auth Unity SDK](/sdk/unity).

### Installation

<UnityInstallation />

### Configure Deep Link (for Android and iOS)

<UnityDeeplink />

## Initialization

---

After Installation, the next step to using Web3Auth is to Initialize the SDK.

However, Initialization is a two-step process:

1. [Creating a Web3Auth Instance](#create-web3auth-instance)
2. [Setting up Web3Auth Options](#setting-up-web3auth-options)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you must pass on different parameters according to the preference of your project.
Additionally, You must configure Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication within this step if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

### Create Web3Auth Instance

<UnityInitialization />

### Setting up Web3Auth Options

<UnitySetOptions />

## Authentication

---

Once you've installed and successfully initialized Web3Auth, you can use it to authenticate your users.

### Logging in

The `web3Auth.login(LoginParams)` function helps your user to trigger the login process. The login flow will be triggered based on the selected
provider.

<UnityLoginExamples />

When connecting, the `login` function takes the LoginParams arguments for the login. See the [LoginParams](/sdk/unity/usage#arguments) for more
details.

#### Sample loginResponse

<UnityResponse />

### Get the User Profile

You can associate a function to be triggerred on successful login. This function will receive the user's profile as a parameter.

```cs
void Start()
{
    web3Auth = GetComponent<Web3Auth>();
    web3Auth.setOptions(new Web3AuthOptions()
    {

    });
    // highlight-next-line
    web3Auth.onLogin += onLogin;
}
//highlight-start
private void onLogin(Web3AuthResponse response)
{
    // Functions to be called after logging in your user
}
//highlight-end
```

Using the `web3Auth.login` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network.

If you wish you **[add Multi Factor Authentication](/sdk/unity/mfa)**, **[use dApp Share](/sdk/unity/dapp-share)** or
**[select Curve](/sdk/unity/usage#selecting-curve)** for your Unity Game, read the linked documentation.

- [Multi Factor Authentication](/sdk/unity/mfa)
- [Using dApp Share](/sdk/unity/dapp-share)
- [Selecting Curve](/sdk/unity/usage#selecting-curve)

### Logout

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `web3Auth.logout()` function.

```cs
public void logout()
{
    web3Auth.logout();
    Debug.Log("Logged out!");
}
```

:::tip

Additionally you can associate a function to be triggerred on successful logout.

```cs
void Start()
{
    web3Auth = GetComponent<Web3Auth>();
    web3Auth.setOptions(new Web3AuthOptions()
    {

    });
    // highlight-next-line
    web3Auth.onLogout += onLogout;
}
//highlight-start
private void onLogout()
{
    // Functions to be called after user logs out
}
//highlight-end
```

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[Web3Auth Unity Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/tree/main/unity). Check it out and try running it locally yourself!

For your reference, here's the Web3Auth.cs file we developed during the course of this guide.

```cs title="/Assets/Web3Auth.cs"
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class Web3custom : MonoBehaviour
{
    Web3Auth web3Auth;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        web3Auth = GetComponent<Web3Auth>();
        web3Auth.setOptions(new Web3AuthOptions()
        {
            redirectUrl = new Uri("torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth"),
            clientId = "BAwFgL-r7wzQKmtcdiz2uHJKNZdK7gzEf2q-m55xfzSZOw8jLOyIi4AVvvzaEQO5nv2dFLEmf9LBkF8kaq3aErg",
            network = Web3Auth.Network.TESTNET,
        });
        web3Auth.onLogin += onLogin;
        web3Auth.onLogout += onLogout;
    }

    public void login()
    {
        var selectedProvider = Provider.GOOGLE;
        var options = new LoginParams()
        {
            loginProvider = selectedProvider
        };
        web3Auth.login(options);
    }

    private void onLogin(Web3AuthResponse response)
    {
        var userInfo = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response.userInfo, Formatting.Indented);
        Debug.Log(userInfo);
    }

    public void logout()
    {
        web3Auth.logout();
    }

    private void onLogout()
    {
        Debug.Log("Logged out!");

    }
}

```
