This guide will help you make a react application using Web3Auth MPC α (Alpha) SDK, covering the basic functionality on how to use it. For a detailed
reference, you can refer to the [Web3Auth MPC SDK Reference](/sdk/web/modal-mpc).

**Live Demo:** https://demo-mpc.web3auth.io

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torusresearch/w3a-mpc-demo.git
npm install
npm start
```

## Prerequisites

---

- A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.
- Ideal to have a knowledge about Web3 and making RPC Calls.
- Create a Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/)

## Understanding the Web3Auth MPC α (Alpha) SDK

---

With the Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your devices and our Auth Network. This is done to ensure
that your key is never stored in a single place and is always available to you. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically
reconstructed in the frontend using threshold signatures, with the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi Party Computation) architecture, it is never reconstructed.
Instead, these partial keys are stored all across the different locations, and your device is used to make partial signatures for your message/
transaction. These are finally returned to the frontend where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make a final
signature. You can use this finally signed message/transaction to make a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth
network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous benefits, especially in terms of security.

You can have a look at how we devide the private key here:

Please note that in MPC there is no key reconstruction at all. For this guide here, we will be talking through the
[Web3Auth MPC α (Alpha) SDK](/sdk/web/modal-mpc) and showing you a basic example of how to use it.

## Setup

---

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

### Setup your Base Project

<SetupBaseProject />

For this guide, we'll be using a React application to demonstrate how the Web3Auth MPC α (Alpha) SDK works. You can use any other framework of your
choice using any other Web3Auth [Guides](./) / [Examples](/docs/examples). Just modify the functions to make it work.

## Installation

---

We have published our MPC enabled SDKs under a different package name. These are ultimately the same packages but available in a different package for
the alpha release. Ultimately these will be merged into the main Web3Auth SDK. You can download the following SDKs to get started.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/web3auth @web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter @web3auth-mpc/base torus-mpc
```

### Understanding the Dependencies

##### `@web3auth-mpc/web3auth`

This is the core Web3Auth package with the Modal UI that contains the main Web3Auth MPC SDK.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/web3auth
```

##### `@web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter`

Openlogin adapter helps you to integrate social logins into your Web3Auth instance. The MPC Openlogin adapter also contains the TSS settings, which
are needed to make the TSS signatures.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter
```

##### `@web3auth-mpc/base`

The base package contains the base types that are used in the Web3Auth SDK. This is done to make sure your types remains constant throughout the SDK
usage.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/base
```

#### `torus-mpc`

This package contains the needed TSS functions for the Web3Auth MPC implementation. These functions are needed to be passed into the Openlogin
Adapter.

## Initialization

---

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth MPC SDK is to initialize it.

The Initialization takes a few steps, which basically involves importing & instantiating the packages and then initialising them to be used in your
application.

1. Import the Web3Auth packages
2. Instantiate the packages
3. Initialize the Web3Auth SDK

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to your project. For the sake of this
guide, we will be using the following code for initialization:

### Import the following packages

Import the following `@web3auth-mpc` and `torus-mpc` packages into your project.

```js
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth-mpc/web3auth";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter";
import { SafeEventEmitterProvider } from "@web3auth-mpc/base";
import { tssDataCallback, tssGetPublic, tssSign, generatePrecompute } from "torus-mpc";
```

### Instantiate the packages

Ideally the instantiation and initialisation should be done with the constructor of the application. For this guide, we'll be instantiating these in
the `useEffect` function of React.

#### Instantiate Web3Auth

```js
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // Client ID from your Web3Auth Dashboard
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: "eip155",
    chainId: "0x5",
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli",
    displayName: "Goerli Testnet",
    blockExplorer: "https://goerli.etherscan.io/",
    ticker: "ETH",
    tickerName: "Ethereum",
  },
});
```

#### Instantiate Openlogin Adapter

Few things to note here:

1. **Multi Factor Authentication needs to be mandatory**, this is done to ensure that the user has a backup of their key in case they lose their
   device. Please note that the email flow might be buggy right now, you can directly copy the backup phrase and save it somewhere for testing
   purposes.
2. We have a new config called `tssSettings`, these are specifically for the TSS implementation. You can directly pass over the functions imported
   from `torus-mpc` here.
3. In the `adapterSettings`, make sure the network is `development` and `_iframeUrl` is set to `https://mpc-beta.openlogin.com`. This basically points
   to our beta network containing TSS implementation.

```js
const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  // Multi Factor Authentication has to be mandatory
  loginSettings: {
    mfaLevel: "mandatory",
  },
  // TSS Settings needed for TSS implementation
  tssSettings: {
    useTSS: true,
    tssGetPublic,
    tssSign,
    tssDataCallback,
  },
  adapterSettings: {
    // points to the beta mpc network containing TSS implementation
    _iframeUrl: "https://mpc-beta.openlogin.com",
    // network has to be development
    network: "development",
    clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // Client ID from your Web3Auth Dashboard
  },
});
web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

### Initialising Web3Auth

For initialising, you need to directly call the `initModal` function of the Web3Auth instance. This function takes in a few parameters, which are
generally not needed for a basic implementation, however for this alpha you need to pass them over. These configurations basically remove the external
wallet adapters from the Web3Auth Modal. This is because the current alpha doesn't support external wallets as of now. We'll add that iteratively in
the future.

```js
await web3auth.initModal({
  // config to remove the external wallet adapters
  modalConfig: {
    "torus-evm": {
      label: "Torus Wallet",
      showOnModal: false,
    },
    metamask: {
      label: "Metamask",
      showOnModal: false,
    },
    "wallet-connect-v1": {
      label: "Wallet Connect",
      showOnModal: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### Putting it all together

The initialisation portion is one of the most important aspects of using Web3Auth. The following code snippet shows the complete initialization code
for React. We're using the `useEffect` hook to initialise the Web3Auth SDK, this is because ideally the whole initialisation should happen within the
constructor of your framework.

```js
const [web3auth, setWeb3auth] = useState<Web3Auth | null>(null);
const [provider, setProvider] = useState<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>(
		null,
	);
useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    try {
      const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
        clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // Client ID from your Web3Auth Dashboard
        // Additional uiConfig for Whitelabeling can be passed here
        uiConfig: {
          appLogo: "https://images.web3auth.io/web3auth-logo-w.svg",
          theme: "light",
          loginMethodsOrder: ["twitter", "google"],
        },
        chainConfig: {
          chainNamespace: "eip155",
          chainId: "0x5",
          rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_goerli",
          displayName: "Goerli Testnet",
          blockExplorer: "https://goerli.etherscan.io/",
          ticker: "ETH",
          tickerName: "Ethereum",
        },
        enableLogging: true,
      });

      const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
        // Multi Factor Authentication has to be mandatory
        loginSettings: {
          mfaLevel: "mandatory",
        },
        // TSS Settings needed for TSS implementation
        tssSettings: {
          useTSS: true,
          tssGetPublic,
          tssSign,
          tssDataCallback,
        },
        adapterSettings: {
          // points to the beta mpc network containing TSS implementation
          _iframeUrl: "https://mpc-beta.openlogin.com",
          // network has to be development
          network: "development",
          clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID", // Client ID from your Web3Auth Dashboard
        },
      });
      web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
      // config to remove the external wallet adapters
      await web3auth.initModal({
        modalConfig: {
          "torus-evm": {
            label: "Torus Wallet",
            showOnModal: false,
          },
          metamask: {
            label: "Metamask",
            showOnModal: false,
          },
          "wallet-connect-v1": {
            label: "Wallet Connect",
            showOnModal: false,
          },
        },
      });
      setWeb3auth(web3auth);

      if (web3auth.provider) {
        setProvider(web3auth.provider);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("error", error);
    }
  };
  init();
}, []);
```

## Authentication

#### Logging in

You can show the modal in the browser by calling `connect()` function on `web3auth` instance. Your user can choose their preferred login method and
access your application.

```js
const login = async () => {
  if (!web3auth) {
    console.log("web3auth not initialized yet");
    return;
  }
  const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connect();
  setProvider(web3authProvider);
  generatePrecompute(); // <-- So one precompute would be available to your users.
};
```

:::note

MPC Signing has two parts, generating the pre compute and the actual signing process. The pre compute takes up the maximum time of both the functions
and can be called in advance for more prompt signing.

For now, `tssSign` of `torus-mpc` package calls `generatePrecompute()` automatically, so you don't have to.

But it is recommended to call `generatePrecompute()` before making a transaction to achieve faster signing. One `generatePrecompute()` call could be
done after a succesfull authentication of user.

:::

### Get the User Profile

```js
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
console.log("User info", user);
```

Using the `getUserInfo` function, you can get the details of the logged in user. Please note that these details are not stored anywhere in Web3Auth
network, but are fetched from the id_token you received from Auth0 and lives in the frontend context.

### Logout

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function.
