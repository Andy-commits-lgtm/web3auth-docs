## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you over a basic example to integerate torus wallet with Binance Smart Chain.

We will go through a simple html page app where user can login in to torus wallet, connect over binance smart chain and can sign a transactions using torus wallet.


## Let's get started with code by installing depedencies using npm

To start with using torus wallet with a binance smart chain dapp , you need to
install torus-embed and web3. You can use popular package managers like yarn and npm
to down them. In this guide we will load them over cdn script.

```shell
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@toruslabs/torus-embed"> <script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ethereum/web3.js@1.0.0-beta.34/dist/web3.js"></script>
```

## Initialize torus wallet with binance test net:

```js
    const torus = new Torus({
          buttonPosition: 'bottom-left', // customize position of torus icon in dapp
        })

    window.torus = torus
    await torus.init(
        {
            enableLogging: true,
            network: {
                host: "https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/", // mandatory
                networkName: "Smart Chain - Testnet",
                chainId: 97,
                blockExplorer: "https://testnet.bscscan.com",
                ticker: 'BNB',
                tickerName: 'BNB',
            },
            showTorusButton: true,
        }
    )
```

In above code snippet, we are creating an instance of torus-embed and then initializing it with binance smart chain test node configuration.
We can pass other configuration options while initializing for customizing torus wallet interface. You can refer to torus-embed [api-reference](https://docs.tor.us/wallet/api-reference/class) to know more on that.

## Trigger user login

Simply call torus.login to trigger user login wherever it makes sense in your application lifecycle:

Calling login without any parameter will open a modal for user to select all supported logins:

```
  await window.torus.login();
```

See [api reference](https://docs.tor.us/wallet/api-reference/class) for more details.

## Using torus web3 instance to fetch user account address and balance

After login with torus wallet it provides us with a http provider as `torus.provider` which can be feeded in to web3 js to interact with binance smart chain.

It also provides us with an interface to access user login information like user's email , profile image etc.

```js

    const user = await window.torus.getUserInfo(); // user profile info (email address etc)

    const web3 = new Web3(window.torus.provider);
    window.web3 = web3
    const address = (await web3.eth.getAccounts())[0];
    const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(address);

```

## Using torus web3 provider instance to sign transactions.

Now we have access to a web3 instance using which we can do anything from signing transactions to accessing other methods of web3.

Every time you will try to sign a transaction it will automatically open torus wallet window for user where user can confirm transaction.

```js
 window.web3.eth.getAccounts((error, accounts) => {
  if (error) throw error;
    const txnParams = {
        from: accounts[0],
        to: accounts[0], // any valid receiver address
        value: "0.1"
    }
  window.web3.eth.sendTransaction(txnParams, (error, txnHash) => {
    if (error) throw error;
    console.log(txnHash);
  });
});
```


## Log out handler
To logout user which means to clean up the web3 instance ,it simply requires you to call  `logout` function on torus wallet instance

```js
   await window.torus.logout()
```

## DONE!!
