This guide will walk you through the process of building a browser extension with Web3Auth.

Repository: https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/tree/main/web-modal-sdk/browser-extension/chrome-extension-web3auth-example

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples.git
cd examples/web-modal-sdk/browser-extension/chrome-extension-web3auth-example
```

- In your browser go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable Developer mode
- Click on Load unpacked and select the `build` folder from the folder path mentioned above

The extension should now be installed and you can click on the extension icon to interact with it.

End product of this guide:

<img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} alt="" src={ExtensionImage} />

Once logged in you can have all the features Web3Auth provides and along with blockchain libraries like ethers.js, web3.js, etc you can interact with
the blockchain.

<img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", margin: "20px auto" }} alt="" src={ExtensionLoggedInImage} />

## How it works?

---

We can integrate `@web3auth/core` as well as `@web3auth/modal` to build a browser extension with Web3Auth. You can read more about both the SDKs in
the [SDKs](/docs/sdk/web) section. The login flow of the user is as follows:

![Web3Auth Core - Social Login Flow](/images/implicit-flow.svg)

## Prerequisites

---

<Web3AuthPrerequisites />

- [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/)

We will be building the chrome extension with `create-react-app` in this guide.

## Setup

---

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

<SetupWeb3AuthDashboard />

:::note

Once you have the build folder ready for the extension, you would need to go to `chrome://extensions/` and load the unpacked extension from the build
folder. That will give you the extension ID which you would need to add to the Web3Auth Dashboard.

Add `chrome-extension://<extension-id>` to the Whitelisted URLs in the Web3Auth Dashboard.

## Using the Web3Auth SDK

---

### Installation

Install `@web3auth/core`, `@web3auth/openlogin-adapter` & `@web3auth/base`

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3auth/core @web3auth/base @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

#### Import the Web3Auth Modules into your project

```js title="src/App.tsx"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Web3Auth } from "@web3auth/core";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES, SafeEventEmitterProvider } from "@web3auth/base";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
```

#### Fixing Webpack 5 issues

While using create-react-app, you may run into issues building. This is because NodeJS polyfills are not included in the latest version of webpack 5.
To solve this, please have a look at this [troubleshooting page](https://docs.web3auth.io/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) where we have added the
resolution.

### Initialization

Create the Web3Auth instance and configure the Openlogin adapter as per your requirements.

```js title="src/App.tsx"
const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  clientId,
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x13881",
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/polygon_mumbai",
  },
  web3AuthNetwork: "cyan",
});

// refer to https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/openlogin for learning more about configuring the adapter
const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter();
web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);
```

### Authentication

Once initialized, you can use the `connectTo` method to authenticate the user.

```js
const provider = await web3auth.connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
  loginProvider: "google",
});
```

### Get the User Profile

```js
// Assuming the user is logged in.
const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo();
```

### Logout

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `web3auth.logout()` function.

```js
await web3auth.logout();
```
