This guide will help you make a react application using Web3Auth Self Host SDK, covering the basic functionality on how to use it and get started
quickly. For a detailed reference, you can refer to the [Web3Auth Self Host SDK Reference](/sdk/self-host).

**Live Demo:** https://w3a.link/self-host-example

## Quick Start

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/tree/main/self-host/self-host-react-example
cd self-host/self-host-react-example
npm install
npm start
```

## Prerequisites

---

- A basic knowledge of JavaScript and React.
- Ideal to have a knowledge about service workers in React.
- A [Google Developer](https://console.developers.google.com/) account to be used as Login provider for Web3Auth Custom Authentication.
- Create a Web3Auth account on the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/)

## Setup

---

### Setup your Google App

1. Follow Googleâ€™s instructions to [set up an OAuth 2.0 app.](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)
2. Add your application's redirect URI into the "Authorized redirect URIs" field. This is the URL that Google will redirect to after authentication.
   `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect`

   ![Google OAuth2.0 App Dashboard](/contents/social-providers/google/google-app-redirect-uri.png)

3. Obtain the OAuth `Client ID` from your [App on the Google Developer dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/)

### Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard

- Create a **Verifier** from the **Custom Auth** Section of the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) with following
  configuration:

  - Choose a name of your choice for the verifier identifier. `eg. google-core-verifier-ssv`
  - Select environment: `testnet`, `mainnet`, `aqua`, `celeste` or `cyan` as per your requirement.
  - Select `Google` from the **Login Provider**. ![Google - Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/login-providers-list.png)
  - Paste the **Client ID** from the Google App(above) to the `Client ID` field.
    ![Google Client ID on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/google-verifier.png)
  - Click on `Create` button to create your verifier. It may take up to 10-20 minutes to deploy verifier on _testnet_. You'll receive an email once
    it's complete.

- You will require the `verifierName` of the newly created verifier.

### Setting up your React Project

We will need to use service workers while implementing the tKey SDK to handle the redirect login flow. This can be done by using a progressive react
application.

For a new project, get started with the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app tkey-demo --template cra-template-pwa-typescript
cd tkey-demo
```

For an existing project, add a service worker.

### Setting up the service worker

Further, we need to setup the service worker according to our needs of the project, i.e handling the redirect login flow. Service worker basically
sits between the frontend application, browser and the network. For the simplicity of this guide, we have added a boilerplate code. The easiest way to
do that is as follows

```bash
mkdir public/serviceworker
wget https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/blob/main/self-host/self-host-react-example/public/serviceworker/sw.js -O public/serviceworker/sw.js
```

> For polyfill issues and BigInt issue, please checkout the [troubleshooting page](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues).

## Installation

---

We will be starting with a 2/2 flow, i.e `ShareA: Social Shares` and `ShareB: Device Share` and later will allow users to add more shares of tKey. i.e
`2/n`

For this project, we will be using `@tkey/default` that contains all the needed functionalities of the tKey SDK.

```bash
npm install --save @tkey/default @tkey/web-storage @tkey/security-questions
```

- `@tkey/web-storage`: This module is used to store the Device Share and used in the 2/2 flow. If you're building for Web, We recommed you to start
  with this module. i.e `2/2`, but there are other modules to achieve the same.
- `@tkey/security-questions`: This module is used to create a `Share C: Backup Share` allowing `2/3` flows. This is what we have chosen for this
  guide, but there are other ways to achieve the same.

For a detailed reference, you can refer to the [Web3Auth Self Host SDK Reference](/sdk/self-host).

## Initialization

---

After Installation, the next step to use Web3Auth Self Host is to Initialize the SDK.

`src/lib/web3auth.ts`

```ts
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/default";
import WebStorageModule from "@tkey/web-storage";
import SecurityQuestionsModule from "@tkey/security-questions";

// Configuration of Service Provider
const customAuthArgs = {
  baseUrl: `${window.location.origin}/serviceworker`,
  network: "cyan", // based on the verifier network.
};
// Configuration of Modules
const webStorageModule = new WebStorageModule();
const securityQuestionsModule = new SecurityQuestionsModule();

// Instantiation of tKey
export const tKey = new ThresholdKey({
  modules: {
    webStorage: webStorageModule,
    securityQuestions: securityQuestionsModule,
  },
  customAuthArgs: customAuthArgs as any,
});
```

`src/App.tsx`

```ts
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { tKey } from "./lib/web3auth";

function App() {
  // Init Service Provider inside the useEffect Method
  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      // Initialization of Service Provider
      await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).init();
      try {
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
    };
    init();
  }, []);
}
```

## Triggering Login using Service Provider

---

Once you have initialised the Web3Auth Service Provider, you're ready to trigger the login process. This is a needed step since this will generate a
private key which will be needed by the tKey to generate it's share. This is done by calling the `triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey`
instance's of `serviceProvider` property.

```js
const triggerLogin = async () => {
  try {
    // Triggering Login using Service Provider ==> opens the popup
    const loginResponse = await (tKey.serviceProvider as any).triggerLogin({
      typeOfLogin: "google", // type of login
      verifier: "your-web3auth-verifier-name",
      clientId: "your-google-client-id",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```

## Initialise and Reconstruct tKey

---

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate you a Threshold Key corresponding to your login
provider. The below code shows how the device share is added to reconstruct the final private key in the frontend.

```js
const initializeNewKey = async () => {
  try {
    await triggerLogin(); // Calls the triggerLogin() function above
    // Initialization of tKey
    await tKey.initialize(); // 1/2 flow
    // Gets the deviceShare
    try {
      await (tKey.modules.webStorage as any).inputShareFromWebStorage(); // 2/2 flow
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      // highlight-next-line
      await recoverShare(); // <-- We'll address this later in this guide.
    }

    // Checks the requiredShares to reconstruct the tKey,
    // starts from 2 by default and each of the above share reduce it by one.
    const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
    if (requiredShares <= 0) {
      const reconstructedKey = await tKey.reconstructKey();
      console.log("Private Key: " + reconstructedKey.privKey.toString());
      // This private key will be used to make blockchain calls.
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error, "caught");
  }
};
```

## Generating a new share with a password

---

Generate a new share(`ShareC: Backup Share`) using the security questions module enabling `2/3` flow. One can add more shares from ShareC, but for
simplicity, this is what we have chosen for this guide.

:::warning NOTE

It is mandatory to set up a backup share, else upon losing the access of device Share, the user will also loose access to their account.

:::

```js
const generateNewShareWithPassword = async () => {
    // swal is just a pretty dialog box
    swal("Enter password (>10 characters)", {
      content: "input" as any,
    }).then(async (value) => {
      if (value.length > 10) {
        await (tKey.modules.securityQuestions as any).generateNewShareWithSecurityQuestions(value, "whats your password?");
        swal('Success', 'Successfully generated new share with password.', 'success');
      } else {
        swal("Error", "Password must be > 10 characters", "error");
      }
    });
    await getTKeyDetails();
  };
```

## Set up Recovery Flow

---

The Recovery flow generates a new share and adds it into the `WebStorageModule`. To do so, we take the answer of the Question from the
`SecurityQuestionsModule` setup in the `generateNewShareWithPassword()` function above.

```ts
const recoverShare = async () => {
  // swal is just a pretty dialog box
  swal("Enter password (>10 characters)", {
    content: "input" as any,
  }).then(async (value) => {
    if (value.length > 10) {
      try {
        await (tKey.modules.securityQuestions as any).inputShareFromSecurityQuestions(value); // 2/2 flow
        tKey.reconstructKey();
        const shareStore = await tKey.generateNewShare();
        await (tKey.modules.webStorage as any).storeDeviceShare(shareStore.newShareStores[1]);
        swal("Success", "Successfully logged you in with the recovery password.", "success");
      } catch (error) {
        swal("Error", (error as any)?.message.toString(), "error");
        logout();
      }
    } else {
      swal("Error", "Password must be >= 11 characters", "error");
      logout();
    }
  });
};
```

## Interacting with Blockchain

So if you have completed this far, it means that you have successfully authenticated your user and resconstructed the key in the frontend. Now, you
can directly use the private key to make the RPC calls to any blockchain making Web3Auth chain agnostic.

## Example code

The code for the application we developed in this guide can be found in the
[examples repository](https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/blob/main/self-host/self-host-react-example). Check it out and try running it locally
yourself!
