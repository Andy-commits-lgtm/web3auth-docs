Web3Auth has been chain agnostic since inception, and this guide will talk about using Web3Auth SDK
in iOS, and integrating Solana chain to fetch the user's account, balance, sign transactions, and
broadcast a transaction. For this guide, we'll be using Web3Auth's default verifier.

## Before you being

1. Learn about [Web3Auth's high level architecture](/docs/how-web3auth-works.mdx)
2. [Check the iOS prerequisites](/docs/sdk/pnp/ios#requirements)
3. [Setup your Web3Auth Dashboard](/docs/dashboard-setup/projects-and-analytics.mdx)
4. [Install Web3Auth iOS SDK](/docs/sdk/pnp/ios/install.mdx)
5. [Initialize WebAuth iOS SDK](/docs/sdk/pnp/ios/initialize.mdx)

## Interacting with the Blockchain

This guide assumes you have already initialized Web3Auth SDK and authenticated the user. If you are
new to Web3Auth, you can checkout our [Web3Auth iOS intergration guide](/src/pages/guides/ios.mdx).

To interact with Solana, we are going to use the
[solana-swift](https://github.com/p2p-org/solana-swift) SDK.

### Private Key

For the Solana chain, we'll be retriving the ed25519 private key. The ed25519 returns the keypair,
from which we can use the first 32 byte for the private key.

```swift
let privateKey: String = try web3Auth.getEd25519PrivKey();
```

### Get Account

In this step, we'll create the account from the user's private key and use `KeyPair` to create
Solana KeyPair. The `KeyPair` can retrieve the user's EOA address and sign the transactions.

```swift title="Create KeyPair"
do {
   let privateKey: String = try Web3Auth.getEd25519PrivKey();
   let keyPair: KeyPair = try KeyPair(secretKey: Data(hex: privateKey))
   let address = keyPair.publicKey.base58EncodedString
} catch let error {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Get Balance

Once we have created the `KeyPair`, we can retrieve the EOA address and fetch the user's SOL
balance. To fetch the user's balance, we'll create the `JSONRPCAPIClient` which will help us
interact with Solana blockchain.

For this guide, we are using the Devnet network, but you can use the Mainnet or Testnet. Check out
the [Solana public RPCs](https://solana.com/rpc).

```swift title="Get SOL balance"
let endpoint = APIEndPoint(
    address: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
    network: .devnet
)

let solanaJSONRPCClient = JSONRPCAPIClient(endpoint: endpoint)

do {
    let balanceResponse = try await solanaJSONRPCClient.getBalance(
        account: keyPair.publicKey.base58EncodedString
    )

    let solBalance = balanceResponse.convertToBalance(decimals: 9).description
} catch let error {
    // Handle error
}
```

### Send Transaction

For sending SOL, we'll create a `BlockchainClient` instance, which will help us broadcast a signed
transaction on the Solana.

```swift title="Send transaction"
let endpoint = APIEndPoint(
    address: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
    network: .devnet
)

let solanaJSONRPCClient = JSONRPCAPIClient(endpoint: endpoint)
let blockchainClient = BlockchainClient(apiClient: solanaJSONRPCClient)

do {
    let transaction = try await blockchainClient.prepareSendingNativeSOL(
        from: keyPair,
        to: "2idRaWFin4Zn5WY9or6XBhcoF6cyfDWSbJQ26jAtptxD",
        amount: 0.01.toLamport(decimals: 9)
    )

    let hash = try await blockchainClient.sendTransaction(preparedTransaction: transaction)
} catch let error {
    // Handle error
}
```
