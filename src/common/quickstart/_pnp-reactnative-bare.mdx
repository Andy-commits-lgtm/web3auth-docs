### 1. Install Web3Auth

Install Web3Auth's React Native package in your React Native project. When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a
`WebBrowser` implementation made by us and a `Storage` implementation provided by react-native.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser react-native-encrypted-storage
```

:::warning

Please have a look at the troubleshooting guide [here](/troubleshooting/metro-issues), to set up the `globals.js` file and the `metro.config.js` file
for polyfilling.

### 2. Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### 3. Create Web3Auth Instance

Construct the `Web3Auth` instance with:

```tsx
import * as WebBrowser from "@toruslabs/react-native-web-browser";
import EncryptedStorage from "react-native-encrypted-storage";
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const scheme = "web3authrnexample"; // Or your desired app redirection scheme
const resolvedRedirectUrl = `${scheme}://openlogin`;

const clientId = "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, EncryptedStorage, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});
```

### 4. Login your User

Once you're done initializing, just create a button that triggers the login for the user on their request. Logging in is as easy as:

Please note that the v4 react-native-sdk has some breaking changes. For instance, `web3auth.login` is a void method, unlike the older versions of the
SDK. Please refer to the [migration guide](/docs/sdk/pnp/react-native/migration-guide-to-v4) for more.

```tsx
await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
});
```
