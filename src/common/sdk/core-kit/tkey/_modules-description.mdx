Modules extend the tKey SDK's capability to provide additional functionality for managing your tKey shares. Out of the multiple modules available, you
can choose the module you want to include in your implementation. Here is the list of available modules:

### Default Modules (Needed for basic operations)

- **tKey Share Serialization Module [`@tkey/share-serialization`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/share-serialization):** Adds the capability to import/
  export a share from `tKey`.

- **tKey Share Transfer Module [`@tkey/share-transfer`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/share-transfer):** Adds the capability to transfer a share to
  another device.

:::note

These modules are automatically configured for you in the tKey SDK. You don't need to additionally add them.

### Share B (Storage Modules)

Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage. You can choose any of the following modules:

- **tKey Web Storage Module [`@tkey/web-storage`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/web-storage):** Adds the capability to add or remove a share from the
  local and file storage.

  ```ts
  import WebStorageModule from "@tkey/web-storage";
  const webStorageModule = new WebStorageModule();
  ```

- **tKey Chrome Storage Module [`@tkey/chrome-storage`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/chrome-storage):** Adds the capability to add or remove a share
  from the chrome extension storage.

  ```ts
  import ChromeExtensionStorageModule from "@tkey/chrome-storage";
  const chromeStorageModule = new ChromeExtensionStorageModule();
  ```

:::tip

Share Transfer Module can act as a Storage Module as well here.

### Share C (Recovery Modules)

Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to their device/storage or needs additional security. You
can choose any of the following modules:

- **tKey Security Questions Module [`@tkey/security-questions`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/security-questions):** Adds the capability to add or remove
  a question and password as a share.

  ```ts
  import SecurityQuestionsModule from "@tkey/security-questions";
  const securityQuestionsModule = new SecurityQuestionsModule();
  ```

:::tip

Share Serialization Module can act as a Recovery Module as well here.

### Additional Modules

These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing private keys or seedphrases. You can choose any of the
following modules:

- **tKey Seed Phrase Module [`@tkey/seed-phrase`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/seed-phrase):** Adds the capability to store and use seedphrases on the
  metadata.

  ```ts
  import SeedPhraseModule from "@tkey/seed-phrase";
  const seedPhraseModule = new SeedPhraseModule();
  ```

- **tKey Private Keys Module [`@tkey/private-keys`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/private-keys):** Adds the capability to store extra private keys on the
  metadata.

  ```ts
  import PrivateKeyModule from "@tkey/private-keys";
  const privateKeyModule = new PrivateKeyModule();
  ```
