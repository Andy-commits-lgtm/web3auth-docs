## How Authentication works

The Single Factor Auth (SFA) SDK enables the creation of embedded wallets using your preferred
authentication provider. Unlike the traditional auth service flow, where users are redirected to
Web3Auth's user flow screens for verification, the SFA SDK facilitates seamless authentication
without requiring a redirect. For a clearer understanding, please refer to the user flow screens
below.

Since SFA handles authentication without redirect, you'll need to create a verifier and manage the
OAuth login yourself. After setting up the verifier and completing the OAuth login, pass the JWT
token, verifier name, and JWT verifier ID. These details are sent to the Web3Auth network, where
they are verified using the JWKS and authentication fields specified in your verifier.

On the Web3Auth network, there are nine nodes that independently verify these details. Verification
is considered successful when at least five out of the nine nodes confirm the details. Once
authentication is successful, you can use the private key to derive the user's public key and
perform on-chain transactions.

Now that you understand how authentication works in the SFA SDK, let's explore how to create a
verifier.

## Create Verifier

Web3Auth providers

- Social Login Providers: Social Login Providers allows you to easily integrate popular social login
  providers like Google, Auth0, Facebook, Discord, and Twitch.
  - Custom Provider: Custom Provider allows you to bring your own OAuth provider of your choice to
    Web3Auth. This set up is particularly useful for applications integrating federated identity
    providers like Firebase, Cognito, or Okta, allowing for a tailored authentication experience. If
    you want to integrate your in house authentication provider, you can choose Custom Provider.
  - Aggregate Multiple Providers: Since addresses generated for the users are specific to the
    verifiers, you can create an aggregate verifier to combine Google and Email Passwordless logins
    under a single verifier ensure that users receive the same private key regardless of their
    chosen method.

1. Go to the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and select your project. Click on
   the `Custom Authentication` tab and then click on the `Create Verifier` button to make a new
   verifier.

1. Give a unique name to your verifier in the `Verifier Identifier` field. e.g., `sfa-verifier`.

1. From the list of Login Providers, you can select the right one. Here we have selected Custom
   Providers, and entered the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint URL in the JWKS Endpoint field. e.g.,
   `https://your-domain/.well-known/jwks.json`

1. (Optional) If you have already have s sample of JWT token using that will be generated through
   OAuth, you can paste a sample JWT token in the `Paste a JWT Token here` field. This is optional,
   but it helps you select the correct JWT validation rules.

1. Select the JWT Verifier ID from the dropdown list of `JWT Verifier ID`.

1. Next, click on `Add Custom Validation` in the `Select JWT validation` section. Then, input `iss`
   in the Field and `https://api.telegram.org` in the Value field. And click on the `Add Validation`
   button.

1. Finally, click on the `Create` button to create the Telegram Custom Authentication verifier.

   It typically takes 5-10 minutes for the verifier to go live. Once deployed & live, you'll receive
   an email and the dashboard will display the 'Live' status for the verifier.
