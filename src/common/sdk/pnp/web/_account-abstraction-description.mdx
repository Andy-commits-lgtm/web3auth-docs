Web3Auth offers seamless integration of Account Abstraction with just a few lines of code, making it
easier than ever to onboard users into decentralized applications. Our goal is to simplify and
streamline the entire process while ensuring users benefit from advanced functionality. With native
support for Account Abstraction, you can effortlessly create ERC-4337 compatible Smart Contract
Wallets (SCWs), giving users the ability to perform batch transactions and efficiently manage gas
sponsorship.

Additionally, SCWs unlock advanced control and programmability for users. They enable the automation
of tasks such as swapping ETH to USDT when the price reaches $2,700, setting spending limits, and
utilizing multi-signature accounts for enhanced security.

Web3Auth's native account abstraction gives you the flexibility to choose your preferred account
abstraction provider, configure your bundler client, and integrate your paymaster. For more insights
