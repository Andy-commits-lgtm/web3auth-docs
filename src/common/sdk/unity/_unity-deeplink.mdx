Unity SDK works on unity deep linking features to redirect the callback from Web3Auth. Before building the application for Android/IOS you need to
register the redirect_uri which can be done easily by the tool provided inside the SDK. To achieve that, you need to follow the steps mentioned below.

- Open deep link generator tool provided by Web3Auth Unity SDK from `Window > Web3Auth > Deep Link Generator`

  <img src={deepLinkGenerator} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Unity Deeplink Generator" />

- Enter the `redirect_url` `{{SCHEMA}}://{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}/auth` and click generate.

:::tip

We're using `torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth` as the `redirect_url` in our example just to give you a reference on how your app's
`redirect_url` should look like.
