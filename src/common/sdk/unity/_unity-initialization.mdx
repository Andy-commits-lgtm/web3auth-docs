Attach a `Web3Auth.cs` script to your game object where you are planning to write your authentication code.

:::tip

You can refer to following sample file on how your boilerplate script should look like:

```cs title="/Assets/Web3Auth.cs"
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public class Web3Auth : MonoBehaviour
{
  // Start is called before the first frame update
  void Start() {}
  public void login() {}
  private void onLogin(Web3AuthResponse response) {}
  public void logout() {}
  private void onLogout() {}
}
```

:::

Within your script, import the `Web3Auth` component in your class.

```cs
Web3Auth web3Auth;
```

Next create an instance within your `Start()` function by creating an instance of the component you just imported.

```cs
web3Auth = GetComponent<Web3Auth>();
```
