Download [.unitypackage](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unity-sdk/releases/tag/Web3Auth-Unity-SDK) from our latest release and import the
package file into your existing Unity3D project.

:::caution

You may encounter errors when importing this package into your existing project.

`The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)`

To fix this problem you need to add the following line into dependencies object which is inside the `Packages/manifest.json` file.

```json title="/Packages/manifest.json"
"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "3.0.2"
```

:::tip

We recommend you to use the [Nethereum Library](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/unity3d-introduction/) for making the blockchain calls. You can
check our documentation on how to integrate Nethereum it with Web3Auth [here](/connect-blockchain/ethereum/unity).
