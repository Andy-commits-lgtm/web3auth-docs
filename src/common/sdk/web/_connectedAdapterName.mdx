You can configure a lot of [adapters](/sdk/web/adapters) in the Web3Auth instance. If you have installed one of the adapters, you can also use the
`connectedAdapterName` to get the currently used adapter.

```javascript
// Initialized Web3Auth instance

// User is logged in using one of the adapters (metamask, torus-evm, etc.)

const adapterName = web3auth.connectedAdapterName;
// returns the currently used adapter name (metamask, torus-evm, etc.)
```
