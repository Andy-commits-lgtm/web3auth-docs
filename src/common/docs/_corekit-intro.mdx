The **Core-Kit** provides a more hands-on approach. It allows developers to define and develop their authentication flows, with Web3Auth being
invisible to the end-user.

**Key Features:**

- **Customizable UI & UX:** Enables you to build and maintain your own UI & UX for login and MFA.
- **Owning the Infrastructure:** Enables you to own the wallet management and the authentication flow.
- **No Redirection:** Unlike PnP, for Core Kit the wallet management flows are not hosted on `app.openlogin.com`. This means that users will not be
  redirected to a different domain for authentication. All the flows can happen within your application.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Available for Web, React Native, iOS and Android.
