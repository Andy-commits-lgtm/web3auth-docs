  - Enter your desired Project name
  - Select the Web3Auth Network as `testnet`. We recommend creating a project in tesnet network during development. And while moving to a production
    environment, make sure to convert your project to `mainnet`, `aqua`, `celeste` or `cyan` network, otherwise you'll end up losing users and keys.
  - Select the blockchain(s) you'll be building this project on. For interoperability with Torus Wallet, you've an option of allowing the user's
    private key to be used in other applications using Torus Wallet. We currently have this option across `EVM`, `Solana` and `Casper` blockchains.
  - Finally, once you create the project, you've the option to whitelist your URLs for the project. **Please whitelist the domains where your project
    will be hosted.**
