## `Subscribe to Web3Auth lifecycle events`

We can get notified by various events during user's login session by subscribing to web3auth events. You can implement the logic of checking whether user is logged in or not based on these events. Below is the code snippet for subscribing to web3auth events.

```ts

    subscribeAuthEvents(web3auth: Web3Auth) {
      web3auth.on(ADAPTER_STATUS.CONNECTED, (data: CONNECTED_EVENT_DATA) => {
        console.log("Yeah!, you are successfully logged in", data);

      });
      web3auth.on(ADAPTER_STATUS.CONNECTING, () => {
        console.log("connecting");
      });
      web3auth.on(ADAPTER_STATUS.DISCONNECTED, () => {
        console.log("disconnected");
      });
      web3auth.on(ADAPTER_STATUS.ERRORED, (error) => {
        console.log("some
 error or user have cancelled login request", error);
      });
    },

```
