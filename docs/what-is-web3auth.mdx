Web3Auth is a pluggable auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. It streamlines the onboarding of both mainstream and crypto native
users in under a minute by providing experiences that they're most comfortable with. With support for all social logins, web & mobile native
platforms, wallets, and other key management methods, **Web3Auth results in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and
application.**

## What does Web3Auth do?

---

With Web3Auth integrated into your application, your user can sign up using the flow of their choice:

- **Mainstream Social Account Logins & Passwordless flows**: Users can register via Google, Twitter, GitHub, and any other OAuth providers of their
  choice. Users can also register via a passwordless flow, where they can sign in with a link sent to their email. This is enabled by our key
  infrastructure [(tKey)](https://github.com/tkey/tkey). Learn more about the key management and security of tkey and our infrastructure
  [here](/overview/key-management).

- **Holistic Web3 Wallet/Key Management Support**: Empower users to use their wallet or key management of choice. Users can use the Web3Auth suite to
  use their existing wallet or key management and hook it up with your application directly.

### Features

- **Seamless Onboarding:** Our social login flows are indistinguishable from Web2.0 logins, contributing to greatly improved user experience and
  onboarding.
- **Non-custodial Public Key Infrastructure:** The user controls ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair. Login services only ever have
  access to one share; thus, it's impossible for the provider to retrieve the user's private key on their own.
- **Whitelabel:** Customize Web3Auth's UI such that it blends directly into your application
- **Web and native mobile:** Web3Auth works both on web as well as mobile out of the box, with native and hybrid applications supported.
- **Using your existing auth/userbase:** Plug into your existing userbase or auth. Zero migration is necessary.
- **Integrable in 5 minutes** - Thatâ€™s it!
