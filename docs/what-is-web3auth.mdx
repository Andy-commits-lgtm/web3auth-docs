Web3Auth is a pluggable auth suite for Web3 wallets and applications. It onboards both mainstream and crypto native users under a minute by providing
experiences that they're most comfortable with. With support for all social logins, web & mobile native platforms, wallets and other key management
methods, Web3Auth results in a standard **cryptographic key provider specific to the user and application**. To experience it for yourself check out
some [examples](/usecases) or our [dashboard itself](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
