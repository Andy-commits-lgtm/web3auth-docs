To use your own auth with Web3Auth we use the CustomAuth SDK, integrating is actually relatively easy and can be done
with not too much code.

The steps for integration are:

1. **[Designing your key management architecture](designing-your-key-management-architecture):** decide on which logins (verifiers) you'd like to implement, your authentication structure
and more

2. **Deploying a verifier on testnet via the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io)**: once you've designed your key management architecture
for your app we can deploy your app-specific verifier scripts on the Torus Network. This would require you to similarly setup the different logins/auths you have chosen
with the respective parties. For example with Goolge you need a clientID. Any generic OAuth follow the details (here)[/customauth/setting-up-verifiers/custom-verifier]

<!-- This is done by submitting an append only transaction that
creates the verifier scripts. These are highly limited in updatability thus most applications to test out the
deployed scripts on testnet first. Once deployed, the application can then access and use these verifier scripts
via one or more of our SDKs.  -->

3. **Deploying to mainnet**: and finally once before entering production be sure to convert/deploy your verifier to mainnet [all deployments are done on the developer dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io)

Or start with one of our guides below:


export const tileGroupsData = [
    {
        // name: "Using Your Own Auth",
        // description: "Do everything you can do with OpenLogin and Wallet in a fully customizable way",
        tiles: [
        {
            key: "apple",
            title: "Apple Login",
            icon: "logo-apple.png",
            path: "/guides/customauth-native-applelogins",
        },
        {
            key: "aws-cognito",
            icon: "logo-aws-cognito.png",
            title: "AWS Cognito Hosted UI",
            path: "/guides/customauth-aws-cognito",
        },
        ],
    },
]


<Tiles tileGroups={tileGroupsData} />



<!-- Depending on your application's platform we have different SDKs for integrating
CustomAuth:

- [WebSDK in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/customauth)
- [Android in Java SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-android-sdk)
- [IOS Swift SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-swift-sdk)
- [Native SDK in Java](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-utils-java)
- [React Native Sdk in Javascript](https://github.com/torusresearch/torus-direct-react-native-sdk)

These SDKs implement interactions with the Torus Network which are detailed more
closely
[here](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612)
and
[here](../../key-infrastructure/system-architecture#verifiers-and-key-retrieval).
Each of the SDKs go into further detail with exact implementation details and
example code within their readme's. -->
