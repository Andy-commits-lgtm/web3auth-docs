#### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) which are owned and managed by Web3Auth's
   account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers
   like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc, or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier on the Web3Auth's dashboard.

`Custom Verifier` is needed to let the user login with your custom authentication flow. The Public/Private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. Verifier scripts determine the access structure to your user's keys, and the set Verifier scripts are chosen to determine which logins your
application will ultimately use.

You can read more about verifiers [in this blog post](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612) or
[in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Auth` Dashboard looks something like this:

## Create Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/verifier-modal.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
`Web3Auth`/`Web3AuthNoModal` SDK for setting up the custom authentication.

### Select Environment

Select between `testnet`, `mainnet`, `aqua`, and `cyan`.

- `testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their integration here.
- `mainnet`, `aqua`, & `cyan` are the production environments for scalable applications.

### Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the list to create a verifier of that type.

The following are the list we have on our Dashboard, if something you're loooking is not available in the list, choose `Custom` and provide the JWT
details.

- [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/federated-identity-providers#auth0)

- [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers)

- [Aggregate Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above is only comprehensive to some of the logins our system can support. If you'd like support for a particular login system, send your
query to hello@web3auth.io.

## Aggregate Verifiers

Developers can create `Aggregate Verifiers` from the Web3Auth Dashboard. Combining multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the same address
for your user regardless of their login providers is possible while creating a verifier, for example, combining a `Google` and `Email Passwordless`
login or `Google` and `GitHub` via Auth0 to access the same key for your user. These login methods should share the same Verifier ID, e.g., `email`;
such verifiers are called `Single ID Verifiers`.
