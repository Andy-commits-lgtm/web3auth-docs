A verifier is essentially a configuration that contains information about the OAuth provider you've
chosen for your application. It acts as a bridge between Web3Auth and the OAuth provider, enabling
the Auth Network nodes to query and validate JWT tokens effectively.

## Create Verifier

The `Custom Authentication` tab of a project looks something like this:

![Custom Authentication Dashboard](/images/dashboard/custom-authentication.png)

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a page similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/images/dashboard/create-verifier.png)

Here, you can create a new verifier for your application by specifying the necessary details as per
your OAuth provider / login details.

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The name of your verifier. This is a unique identifier that will be used to reference this verifier.

### Choose a Login Provider

    Select the Login Provider and fill in the details as per the provider you've chosen.

    Refer the below links to learn more about setting up the following authentication service providers:
    1. [Social Login Providers](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers)
    2. [Custom Providers](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-provider)
    3. [Aggregate Multiple Providers](/auth-provider-setup/aggregate-verifier)

## Edit Verifier

Click on the verifier or the three dots next to the verifier you wish to edit and click on
`Edit Verifier` in the dropdown.

The `Edit Verifier` page will appear with previously filled information. Make the necessary changes
and click on the `Update Verifier` button on the bottom.

## Archive Verifier

To archive a verifier from the existing list, click on the three dots next to the verifier you wish
to archive, and then select "Archive Verifier" from the dropdown.

When you archive a verifier, it will no longer be available for use in your application. However,
you can always unarchive it later from the Archive page in the dashboard.
