#### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) which are owned and managed by Web3Auth's
   account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers
   like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc, or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier on the Web3Auth's dashboard.

`Custom Verifier` is needed to let the user login with your custom authentication flow. The Public/Private keys generated for a user are scoped to a
verifier. Verifier scripts determine the access structure to your user's keys, and the set Verifier scripts are chosen to determine which logins your
application will ultimately use.

You can read more about verifiers [in this blog post](https://medium.com/toruslabs/key-assignments-resolution-and-retrieval-afb984500612) or
[in this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/Web3Auth/discussions/427#discussioncomment-3442052).

The `Custom Auth` Dashboard looks something like this:

## Create Verifier

---

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

![Verifier Modal on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/verifier-modal.png)

To create a verifier, you need to input the following details:

### Verifier identifier

The identifier for your verifier. This is used to identify your verifier in the Web3Auth dashboard. You'll need this while initialising the
`Web3Auth`/`Web3AuthCore` SDK for setting up the custom authentication.

### Select Environment

Select between `testnet`, `mainnet`, `aqua`, `celeste` and `cyan`.

- `testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their integration here.
- `mainnet`, `aqua`, `celeste` & `cyan` are the production environments for scalable applications.

### Login Provider

Select the Login Provider from the list to create a verifier of that type.

The following are the list we have on our Dashboard, if something you're loooking is not available in the list, choose `Custom` and provide the JWT
details.

![Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/login-providers-list.png)

**Login Providers Setup**

- [Google](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/google)

- [Facebook](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/facebook)

- [Twitch](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/twitch)

- [Discord](/auth-provider-setup/social-providers/discord)

- [Auth0](/auth-provider-setup/federated-identity-providers#auth0)

- [Custom JWT](/auth-provider-setup/byo-jwt-providers)

### Can XXXX authenticator/login be supported?

The list above isn't comprehensive to all the logins that our system is capable of supporting, if you'd like support for a particular login system do
send your query over to hello@web3auth.io.

## Aggregate Verifiers

---

It is possible to combine multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the same address for your user. For example, combine a `Google` and
`Email Passwordless` login or `Google` and `GitHub` via Auth0 to access the same key for your user. These login methods should share the same Verifier
ID, and such verifiers are called `Single ID Verifiers`. Developers can create `Aggregate Verifiers` from the Web3Auth Dashboard.

### Set up an Aggregate Verifier

1. Create a verifier for your application by selecting `Aggregate` as the Login provider from this modal.
   ![Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-1.png)
2. Click on `Add sub-verifier` to add a new sub-verifier.
   ![Add first sub-verifier on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-2.png)
3. Select `Google` or any other Login provider from this list.
   ![Select Google from Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-3-1.png)
4. Paste the **Client ID** from the Google App to the `Client ID` field and click on `Add`.
   ![Add Google details for the first verifier on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-3-2.png)
5. Now, it's time to create the second sub-verifier. Click on `Add sub-verifier` to add a new sub-verifier.
   ![Add second sub-verifier on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-3.png)
6. Select `Auth0` or `Custom` from the login provider list. We're selecting `Auth0` in this example.
   ![Auth0 as sub verifier on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-4-1.png)
7. Select the `Authentication Type` based on your application need from the dropdown. We're selecting `Github` in this example.
8. Enter the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` from your Auth0 application. See how to create a new Auth0 application
   [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/).

   ![Create Aggregate Verifiier on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-4-2.png)

   :::info NOTE

   1. Add the [GitHub Social Connection](https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/github-social-connection) to your Auth0 application.
   2. One has to request email from user while setting up the GitHub Social Connection on Auth0 Dashboard.

   :::

9. Similarly, creare a third sub verifier for `Email Passwordless` via Auth0. Follow the above step from 5 to 8, and select `Email Passwordless` in
   place of `Github`.
10. Finally, click on `Create` to deploy the verifier. ![Login Providers list on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/aggregate-verifier/av-5.png)

:::info NOTE

You can aggregate two or more verifiers.

```js
import { Web3AuthCore } from "@web3auth/core";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const clientId = "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID";
// get it from https://dashboard.web3auth.io by creating a Plug n Play project.

const web3auth = new Web3AuthCore({
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: "testnet",
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: "eip155",

          domain: "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN", // Pass the Auth0 Domain here, eg. https://shahbaz-torus.us.auth0.com
          // This corresponds to the field inside jwt which must be used to uniquely identify the user.
          verifierIdField: "email", // This is mapped b/w google and github logins.
          isVerifierIdCaseSensitive: false,
        },
      },
      // GitHub Login via Auth0
      github: {
        verifier: "YOUR_AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_NAME", // Pass the Verifier name here. eg. w3a-aggregate-verifier

          // This corresponds to the field inside jwt which must be used to uniquely identify the user.
          verifierIdField: "email", // This is mapped b/w google and github logins.
          isVerifierIdCaseSensitive: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
web3auth.configureAdapter(openloginAdapter);

// Initialize
await web3auth.init();

// When user clicks Google button, use this to Login with Google
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connectTo("openlogin", {
  loginProvider: "google",
});

// When user clicks Email Passwordless button, use this to Login with Email Passwordless via Auth0
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connectTo("openlogin", {
  loginProvider: "emailpasswordless",
});

// When user clicks GitHub button, use this to Login with GitHub via Auth0
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connectTo("openlogin", {
  loginProvider: "github",
});
```
