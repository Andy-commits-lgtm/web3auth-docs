Auth Provider setup refers to the capability of creating a **verifier**(_a way to do custom authentication_) with Web3Auth. By default, Web3Auth comes
with a set of default verifiers that you can use out of the box.

:::info Caveat with Default Verifiers

- **Migration from Default Verifiers to Custom Verifiers is not possible.**
- The default verifier is not suitable for all use cases. For example, if you are using a custom JWT provider, you will need to use the
  [`Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal SDK`](/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/), since the Web3Auth Modal will only help you configure the social logins present
  within the Modal UI.
- **Aggregation of the default verifier is not possible.** For example, if you want to aggregate Google and Email Passwordless, or any two/more social
  providers, you will need to create an Aggregate Verifier, which is not possible if you start with:
  - a Default Verifier
  - or, Social Login Providers
  - or, Custom Providers
