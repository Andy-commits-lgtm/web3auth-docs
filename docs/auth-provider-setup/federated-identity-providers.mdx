Federated / Identity providers enable you to use some implicit and authorization code grants. You could also use social providers on top of Federated
/ Identity providers to select other Social providers (e.g.: Twitter, Apple, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat etc.) that are not natively supported by us.
Note: This will require you to register an app with the Federated / Identity Providers.

**Supported directly through _Web3Auth Dashboard_**
