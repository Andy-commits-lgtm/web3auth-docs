   > Note: For Email Password and Email Passwordless authentication, the `email_verified = true`
   > condition is added to the JWT verification. To avoid JWT params mismatch error, you can use any
   > other Authentication Type.

3. Enter the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` from your Auth0 application. See how to create a
   new Auth0 application [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/).
