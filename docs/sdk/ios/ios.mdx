For using Web3Auth in natively in iOS, Web3Auth provides an [iOS SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk), written in Swift. The Web3Auth
iOS SDK is a client-side library you can use with your iOS app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns a private key generated in a non
custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of the social logins Web3Auth provides or
using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

### Requirements

- iOS 13+
- Xcode 11.4+ / 12.x

## Configuration

---

In order to use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth `ClientId` and which `Network` to run it.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), create or open an existing Web3Auth project and copy your Client ID, which is
  the `ClientId`.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
