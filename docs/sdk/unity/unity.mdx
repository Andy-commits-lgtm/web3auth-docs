The Web3Auth [Unity SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unity-sdk) is a client-side library which allows you to authenticate users using
Web3Auth on `Unity3D` game engine. This SDK has been written majorly in `C#` and can be integrated preferably across all mobile platforms. It returns
a private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be achieved by using any social login
options that Web3Auth supports or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.
