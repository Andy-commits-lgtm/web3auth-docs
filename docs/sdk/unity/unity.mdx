The Web3Auth [Unity SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unity-sdk) is a client-side library which allows you to authenticate users using
Web3Auth on `Unity3D` game engine. This SDK has been written majorly in `C#` and can be integrated preferably across all mobile platforms. It returns
a private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This authentication can be achieved by using any social login
options that Web3Auth supports or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

### Requirements

- Unity Editor 2019.4.9f1 or greater
- .Net Framework 4.x

:::tip

Get started with the sample code provided in our [examples repository](https://github.com/Web3Auth/examples/tree/main/unity)

:::

## Installation

---

### Download the Unity Package

Download [.unitypackage](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-unity-sdk/releases/tag/Web3Auth-Unity-SDK) from our latest release and import the
package file into your existing Unity3D project.

:::caution

You may encounter errors when importing this package into your existing project.

`The type or namespace name 'Newtonsoft' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)`

To fix this problem you need to add the following line into dependencies object which is inside the `Packages/manifest.json` file.

```json title="/Packages/manifest.json"
"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json": "3.0.2"
```

:::tip

We recommend you to use the [Nethereum Library](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/unity3d-introduction/) for making the blockchain calls. You can
check our documentation on how to integrate Nethereum it with Web3Auth [here](/connect-blockchain/ethereum/unity).

## Configuration

---

### Configure a Plug n Play project

- Go to [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), create or select an Web3Auth project:

- Add `{{SCHEMA}}://{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}://auth` to **Whitelist URLs**.

- Copy the `Client ID` for usage later.

### Configure Deep Link (for Android and iOS)

Unity SDK works on unity deep linking features to redirect the callback from Web3Auth. Before building the application for Android/IOS you need to
register the redirect_uri which can be done easily by the tool provided inside the SDK. To achieve that, you need to follow the steps mentioned below.

- Open deep link generator tool provided by Web3Auth Unity SDK from `Window > Web3Auth > Deep Link Generator`

  <img src={deepLinkGenerator} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} />

- Enter the `redirect_url` `{{SCHEMA}}://{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}://auth` and click generate.

:::tip

We're using `torusapp://com.torus.Web3AuthUnity/auth` as the `redirect_url` in our example just to give you a reference on how your app's
`redirect_url` should look like.
