Once you've installed and successfully initialized Web3Auth, you can use it to authenticate your users. Further, you can use the native provider given
by Web3Auth to connect the users to the respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3Auth` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the following functions:

- `connect()` - Showing the Modal and Logging in the User
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

## Logging in the User

---

#### `connect()`

You can show the modal in the browser by calling `connect()` function on `web3auth` instance. Your user can choose their preferred login method and
access your application.

```javascript
await web3auth.connect();
```

#### Returns

```ts
connect(): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;
```

On successful login, the `connect()` function returns a `SafeEventEmitterProvider` instance. This instance contains the respective provider
corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.
