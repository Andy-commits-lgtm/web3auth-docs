For topping up the wallet of a user, you can use the `initiateTopup()` function. This method takes in the parameters of the selected payment provider
and accordingly gives you the option to seemless add money to your user's wallet address directly.

:::info

This uses the [Torus EVM Wallet UI Plugin](/sdk/web/plugins/evm-wallet). Please install and configure the package before using this function.
