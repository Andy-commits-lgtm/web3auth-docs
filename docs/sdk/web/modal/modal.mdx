# Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal

---

## [`@web3auth/modal`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/modal)

This package provides main class for using default Web3Auth Modal. The package includes all of our packages and gives you a simple way of implementing
Web3Auth within your interface. Additionally, it is a child class of [`@web3auth/core`](/sdk/web/no-modal) package. Hence, you can still call all the
functions available in the [`@web3auth/core`](/sdk/web/no-modal) package.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/modal
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.

## Troubleshooting

### Webpack 5 Issues

With the latest version of webpack, you might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing. These dependencies need to be polyfilled
in your application and your app needs to be reconfigured to use them while building.

If you're facing this issue, [checkout our dedicated guide on how to fix it](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues).

## `wagmi` Connector

Now, Web3Auth can be used with wagmi library. **wagmi** is a collection of React Hooks containing everything you need to start working with Ethereum.

Simply use [`@web3auth/web3auth-wagmi-connector`](./wagmi-connector) that is built on top of the `@web3auth/modal` in your dApp to manage the
interactions seemlessly.
