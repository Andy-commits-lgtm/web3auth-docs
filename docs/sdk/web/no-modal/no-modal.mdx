# Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal

---

## [`@web3auth/no-modal`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/no-modal)

Web3Auth Plug and Play No Modal is the main SDK that consists of the core module of Web3Auth Plug and Play. This SDK gives you all the needed modules
for implementing the Web3Auth features, giving you the flexibility of implementing your own UI to use all the functionalities. Since this package
doesn't contain the UI Modal as compared to [`@web3auth/modal`](/sdk/web/modal) package, the size of this package is smaller.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/no-modal
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `typescript`.
