# Web3Auth MPC SDK (Alpha)

---

In the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the frontend using threshold signatures. However, with the new Web3Auth MPC
(Multi Party Computation) architecture, it is never reconstructed. Instead, these partial keys are used to make partial signatures for your message/
transaction. These are finally returned to the frontend where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make a final
signature. You can use this finally signed message/transaction to make a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth
network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous benefits, especially in terms of security.

## Understanding the SDKs

---

### `@web3auth-mpc/web3auth`

This is the core Web3Auth package with the Modal UI that contains the main Web3Auth MPC SDK.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/web3auth
```

### `@web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter`

Openlogin adapter helps you to integrate social logins into your Web3Auth instance. The MPC Openlogin adapter also contains the TSS settings, which
are needed to make the TSS signatures.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/openlogin-adapter
```

### `@web3auth-mpc/base`

The base package contains the base types that are used in the Web3Auth SDK. This is done to make sure your types remains constant throughout the SDK
usage.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth-mpc/base
```

### `torus-mpc`

This package contains the needed TSS functions for the Web3Auth MPC implementation. These functions are needed to be passed into the Openlogin
Adapter. Particularly, this package contains the following functions:

- tssDataCallback
- tssGetPublic
- tssSign
- generatePrecompute
