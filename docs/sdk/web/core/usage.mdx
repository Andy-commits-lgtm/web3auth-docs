Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthCore`, you can use it to authenticate your users. Further, you can use the native provider
given by `Web3AuthCore` to connect the users to the respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3AuthCore` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the following functions:

- `connectTo()` - Logging in the User with the given Wallet Adapter and respective Login Parameters
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `authenticateUser()` - Getting the idToken
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

## Logging in the User

---

<ConnectTo />

#### Returns

```ts
connectTo<T>(walletName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE, loginParams?: T): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;
```

On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

#### Example

:::tip

You can use the `connectTo()` function to connect to the custom authentication verifiers you might have deployed on the Web3Auth Dashboard, as well as
the default ones that Web3Auth provides. For the default verifiers, you don't need to provide any additional parameters, just pass on the login
provider type.

:::

<ConnectToExample />

On successful connection, the `connectTo()` function returns a `SafeEventEmitterProvider` instance. This instance contains the respective provider
corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

:::tip

Read more about connecting your users with the selected blockchain in the [Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/web/providers).

:::

#### `walletName`

<WalletAdapters />

#### `loginParams`

The `loginParams` are specific for each and every function. Please refer to the [Adapters SDK Reference](/sdk/web/adapters) to know more about the
login parameters specific to each wallet adapter.

For `openlogin-adapter` which enables the social logins, you can refer to the following `loginParams`.

<OpenloginLoginParams />

Further, for Custom Authentication, `ExtraLoginOptions` can be used to pass the standard oauth login options.
