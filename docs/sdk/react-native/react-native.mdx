For using Web3Auth in React Native, Web3Auth provides an [React Native SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk), written in
TypeScript. The Web3Auth React Native SDK is a client-side library you can use with your React Native app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It
returns a private key generated in a non custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of
the social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

### Requirements

- React Native Release 0.65 and above (for Bare React Native Workflow)

- Expo SDK 45 and above (for Expo Managed Workflow)

- iOS Platform Target Version 13 and above

- Android Target SDK Version 31 and above

:::note source code

Source code of the SDK can be found **[on GitHub](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk/)**.

:::info Quick Start

You can have a look at the **[examples](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+React+Native+SDK)** made on top of this SDK and try it out
yourself.

## Selecting your Workflow

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

### Expo Managed Workflow

Your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app. Developers build managed workflow apps
using expo-cli on their computer and a development client on their mobile devices (either the Expo Go app for more simple projects or a development
build when your project grows). Managed workflows apps typically use one or more Expo services, such as push notifications, build, and updates.

### Bare React Native Workflow

Your Bare React Native app is entirely built on your own machine. In this workflow the developer has complete control, along with the complexity that
comes with that. Configuration with app.json / app.config.js is mostly not supported in this context; instead, you will need to configure each native
project directly with Swift/Kotlin native modules.

:::tip

You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).

## Installation

#### [`@web3auth/react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

### Adding a Web Browser Module

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the native APIs, and there are different extra
installation steps depending on whether you are using the bare workflow or managed workflow.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="expo"
  values={[
    { label: "Expo Managed Workflow", value: "expo" },
    { label: "Bare React Native Workflow", value: "bare" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="expo">

#### Expo Web Browser

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow, you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation.)

```shell
expo install expo-web-browser
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bare">

#### React Native Web Browser

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

After you have installed the files needed for your workflow, you'll have to configure the SDK with some additional steps to be able to use the SDK
properly.

### Expo Managed Workflow

- Adding URL scheme to `app.json`

To allow the Expo based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated scheme into `app.json`

```json title="app.json"
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "web3authexpoexample" // replace with your own scheme
  }
}
```

- For constructing your `redirectUrl`, you'll need to use the `expo-linking`, which will help you generate a `redirectUrl` for your app. Make sure you
  register that URL in the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

```js title="App.js"
import Constants, { AppOwnership } from "expo-constants";
import * as Linking from "expo-linking";

const resolvedRedirectUrl =
  Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Expo || Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Guest
    ? Linking.createURL("web3auth", {})
    : Linking.createURL("web3auth", { scheme: scheme });
```

You may refer to [these example apps](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+React+Native+SDK) and try it out yourself.

:::

### Bare React Native Workflow

For the bare workflow, you need to perform additional installation steps, alongside specific configuration for Android and iOS separately.

#### Android

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `build.gradle` is 31 or more.

```gradle title="android/build.gradle"
buildToolsVersion = "31.0.0"
minSdkVersion = 21
# highlight-next-line
compileSdkVersion = 31
# highlight-next-line
targetSdkVersion = 31
```

- Add the intent filter with `scheme` defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  # replace with your own scheme
  # highlight-next-line
  <data android:scheme="web3authrnexample" />
</intent-filter>
```

- SDK version 31 requires you to explicitly define `android:exported="true"` in `AndroidManifest.xml`, check whether it is correctly present or not.

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
  android:launchMode="singleTask"
  android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"
# highlight-next-line
  android:exported="true">
```

- Your `redirectUrl` is your defined scheme following some identifier or your choice. For example, if your scheme is `web3authrnexample`, you can
  define your `redirectUrl` as `web3authrnexample://openlogin`. Make sure you register this `redirectUrl` in the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

```js title="App.js"
const scheme = "web3authrnbareexample"; // Or your desired app redirection scheme
const resolvedRedirectUrl = `${scheme}://openlogin`;
```

#### iOS

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `Podfile` is 13 or more.

```Podfile title="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '13'
```

- Install the Cocoa Pods within your project directory.

```shell
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

- In iOS, you don't need to add `redirectUrl` as a iOS Custom URL Scheme, however, you may can add it to your `Info.plist`, but it is not required.
  Make sure your `redirectUrl` is registered in the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).
