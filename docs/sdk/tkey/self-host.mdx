## Understanding the tKey Flow

---

The tKey SDK depends upon the Service Provider, Storage Layer and Modules to work as an off chain multi sig infrastructure working within your app.

### Service Provider

The **Service Provider** helps with the authentication and identification of the user using their social logins and giving the an easy way of account
retreival.

### Storage Layer

The **Storage Layer** refers to the Metadata Storage, which is used to store the metadata information of the shares generated by the tKey SDK.

> You don't need to worry about this while using the `@tkey/default` package

### Modules

[**Modules**](./modules) are the various functionalities that can be added to the tKey SDK, tkey enhance the storage and usage of different shares
generated in a way it is most suitable for your project.

We have 3 types of modules available right now:

- [**Default Modules**](./modules/#default-modules): Modules needed for the basic operations of the tKey SDK.
- [**Storage Modules**](./modules/#storage-modules): Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage.
- [**Recovery Modules**](./modules/#recovery-modules): Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to
  their device/storage or needs additional security.
- [**Additional Modules**](./modules/#additional-modules): These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing
  private keys or seedphrases.

### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the private key. By default, the number is set to `2` which means that at least
two shares are required to reconstruct the private key. This is done to ensure that the private key is not compromised even if one of the shares is
compromised.

### tKey Modes

Apart from this, the tKey SDK internally has multiple modes of operation, which are as follows:

#### Read mode

This happens when atleast 1 share is available to the tKey SDK. In this mode, the tKey SDK can only read the metadata information of the share
currently available to it, alongside the public data of the other shares.

#### Write mode

This happens when 2 or more shares are available to the tKey SDK. Please note that the threshold set by the dApp might change this number required.
Basically once the key threshold is reached, the tKey SDK can write the metadata information of the shares and modify them according to the need of
the user.
