## Why Custom Authentication?

---

Before understanding why custom authentiation (aka Custom Verifer) is needed for the Node.js SDK. Let's understand `What is a Verifier`? and why we
need it for authentiation.

### What is a Verifier?

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token.

There are two types of `Verifiers` at Web3Auth:

1. `Default Verifiers`: These are the verifiers associated with OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) which are owned and managed by Web3Auth's
   account.
2. `Custom Verifiers`: If you want to manage your OAuth providers(Google, Facebook, Apple etc) yourself or to use some Federated Identity Providers
   like Auth0, Firebase, AWS Cognito, Okta etc, or even your Custom JWT Authentication, you'll need to create a verifier on the Web3Auth's dashboard.

:::note

`Custom Verifier` is needed to let the user login with Web3Auth's Node.js SDK.

## MFA and Node.js SDK

---

Let's look at the general authentication flow at Web3Auth.

When a user logs in with Web3Auth, a user's account can be in two states:

- **Account Without MFA**: When the User logs in with only social login and key is secured by Web3Auth network.
- **Account With MFA**: When the User enables MFA by adding other shares like password, backup share, device share, etc., to their existing account.

:::warning warning

`@web3auth/node-sdk` SDK only works for those users who have **not enabled MFA**.

For MFA enabled users, you'll see `Error("User has already enabled mfa, please use the @webauth/webauth-web sdk for login with mfa");`

:::

### Without Openlogin Redirection Flow

By default, to reconstruct the key in both states, Web3Auth SDKs redirects the user to http://app.openlogin.com. Where all the computation to
reconstruct the key is done. The advantage of this approach is that it makes it easy for applications to integrate web3auth SDK without having to
worry about the key reconstruction process. But sometimes, applications want to reconstruct the key in their application context, where the
authentication flow described can be used with Web3Auth's `@web3auth/node-sdk` SDK.

## Create Custom Verifer

---

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button on Web3Auth Dashboard, you'll see a toggle similar to this:

![Custom JWT Provider on Web3Auth Dashboard](/dashboard/verifiers/custom-jwt-verifier.png)

To create a custom verifier for your JWT Providers, you'll need

1. **JWT Verifier ID**

   JWT Verifier ID is the unique identifier to publicly represent a user on a verifier.

   e.g: sub, email, or even a custom field of your JWT etc.

   > This is the `VeriferId` that is passed in the `connect()` of Web3Auth Node SDK.

2. **JWK Endpoint**

   An endpoint containing the JWKS used for signing.

   > Output of jwk endpoint should contain same fields as the example given below.

   ```json
   {
     "keys": [
       {
         "kty": "RSA",
         "e": "AQAB",
         "use": "sig",
         "kid": "1bb9605c36e98e30117a69517569386830202b2d",
         "n": "pAbfKmQ1ljT6yZcrdxaJxqsB7EupbBFcCLiMzmuFQMuk3y_g-vVPR8ZwTJbalwBxD-vUPmxmZAVok_iNthw1mnW0POg3kEwtl1qambgNKlaTeO8S3D-KGlUNV6bU-JXbyquds7v8bQjmIQ5oXhwIQt6x55bEyZTOCQDl3ZHy1XxeBWFyiPUXXnqkO51EFeVNiMi8Ihue16UY_lIizhivl2C_UwJ0Ymx9eWJ-nefPBo7Lr_fIxh81NaLMB6t5L8123RSIaaIcR_r1H_ZbEe9VNTfnGdYS3A0u-pNS_bm5jRSBo1qt01OFu0xEsjcO7-NESTBr8w8SUqGK86tg9oQz5w",

       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **JWT Validations**

   :::caution

   - Your JWT token header must contain the `kid` field and the payload data must contain `iat` field.

   :::

   You can add up to 3 validation fields, including any claims like `aud`, `sub`, `iss`, `email_verified` etc. These are the claims against which a
   JWT is validated.

   Here are a couple of examples to be used in validation:

   - Token Audience ( `aud` ):

     The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients for which the JWT is intended. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify
     itself with a value in the audience claim. If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the "aud" claim when
     this claim is present, then the JWT will be rejected. The `aud` value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. The
     interpretation of audience values is generally application specific.

   - Token Issuer ( `iss` ):

     The issuing authority of the token. The `iss` value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

   - Token Subject ( `sub` ):

     The subject of the token. The `sub` value is a case-sensitive string containing a StringOrURI value. Use of this claim is OPTIONAL.

   - Token Email Verified ( `email_verified` ):

     The email verified claim is a boolean value that indicates whether the email address has been verified.
