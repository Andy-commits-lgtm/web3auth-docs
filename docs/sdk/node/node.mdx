## [`@web3auth/node-sdk`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/node-sdk)

Web3Auth's `@web3auth/node-sdk` SDK is a simple and easy to use SDK in your Node.js backend to get the same experience of Web3Auth frontend SDKs.

Adding Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDK to your application is a great way to authenticate users and reconstruct their private key. Web3Auth Plug and
Play Web SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth hosted screen (i.e. http://app.openlogin.com). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, sometimes you
may want to customize the authentication flow such that you can have more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process (i.e. to avoid the
redirection to openlogin hosted screens). And with Web3Auth's `@web3auth/node-sdk` SDK, you'll be able to use Web3Auth in your Node.js backend and can
also be used to avoid the redirection to openlogin hosted screens.

> Note: With this SDK, you get semi-custodiality.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/node-sdk
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
