The Web3Auth [SFA Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-java) is a client & server side library you can use with your Android
app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. For using One Key flow of Web3Auth natively in Android, Web3Auth provides an SFA Android SDK written in
_Java_ which helps you implement the Web3Auth without redirection in a single key pair flow.

With the Web3Auth Plug and Play Android SDK you can easily and quickly authenticate users and reconstruct their private key. Web3Auth Plug and Play
Android SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth hosted screen (i.e. http://app.openlogin.com). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, sometimes you
may want to customize the authentication flow such that you can have more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process (i.e. to avoid the
redirection). This can be achieved through this new Web3Auth `SFA Android` SDK, where in now, you'll be able to use Web3Auth and avoid the redirection
to openlogin hosted screens.

:::info This SDK gives you semi custodial keys

The `Web3Auth Plug and Play Android SDK` gives you the simplest flow for onboarding a user with Web3Auth. The user just needs to click on the login
button, connect to their favourite social account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like email passwordless, biometric authentication etc., and a
private key is generated for them. This flow has a 1/1 Key Share setup and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth Network key shares is provided directly to
your app, and reconstructed within it.

This flow is still non custodial since the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the key shares. However, one can
claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider, since this is directly generated using credentials provided by them.

Hence we can call this flow a semi-custodial flow.

## Installation

---

### Add Web3Auth to Gradle

In your project-level `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle` file, add JitPack repository:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // highlight-next-line
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" } // <-- Add this line
    }
}
```

Then, in your app-level `build.gradle` dependencies section, add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    // highlight-next-line
    implementation 'com.github.Web3Auth:single-factor-auth-java:0.0.4'
}
```

:::info Latest-SDK

Check the **[latest version of Web3Auth's Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-java/releases)** and update accordingly.

:::

### Permissions

Open your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permission:

```xml
// highlight-next-line
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

> Note: The `<uses-permission>` element must be a direct child of the `<manifest>` root element
