The Web3Auth [SFA Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-java) is a client & server side library you can use with your Android
app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. For natively using the One Key flow of Web3Auth in Android, Web3Auth provides an SFA Android SDK written in
_Java_, which helps you implement the Web3Auth without redirection in a single key pair flow.

With the Web3Auth Plug and Play Android SDK, you can easily and quickly authenticate users and reconstruct their private keys. Web3Auth Plug and Play
Android SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth-hosted screen (i.e., http://app.openlogin.com). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, you may want
to customize the authentication flow to have more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process (i.e., to avoid redirection). This can be
achieved through this new Web3Auth SFA Android SDK, where now, you can use Web3Auth and avoid the redirection to openlogin hosted screens.

:::info This SDK gives you semi custodial keys

The `Web3Auth Plug and Play Android SDK` gives you the most straightforward flow for onboarding a user with Web3Auth. The user needs to click on the
login button, connect to their favorite social account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like email passwordless, biometric authentication, etc., and
a private key is generated for them. This flow has a 1/1 Key Share setup, and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth Network key shares is provided directly
to your app and reconstructed within it.

This flow is still non-custodial since the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the key shares. However, one can
claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider since this is directly generated using credentials provided by them.

Hence, we call this flow a semi-custodial flow.

## Installation

---

### Add Web3Auth to Gradle

In your project-level `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle` file, add JitPack repository:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        // highlight-next-line
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" } // <-- Add this line
    }
}
```

Then, in your app-level `build.gradle` dependencies section, add the following:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    // highlight-next-line
    implementation 'com.github.Web3Auth:single-factor-auth-java:0.0.4'
}
```

:::info Latest-SDK

Check the **[latest version of Web3Auth's Android SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-java/releases)** and update accordingly.

:::

### Permissions

Open your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permission:

```xml
// highlight-next-line
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

> Note: The `<uses-permission>` element must be a direct child of the `<manifest>` root element
