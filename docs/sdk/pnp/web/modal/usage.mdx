Once you've installed and successfully initialized Web3Auth, you can use it to authenticate your
users. Further, you can use the native provider given by Web3Auth to connect the users to the
respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3Auth` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the
following functions:

- `connect()` - Showing the Modal and Logging in the User
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `enableMFA()` - Enable Multi Factor Authentication for the user
- `authenticateUser()` - Getting the idToken from Web3Auth
- `addChain()` - Add chain config details to the connected adapter.
- `switchChain()` - Switch chain as per chainId already added to chain config.
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

Additionally the following methods are available to get information about the current state of the
instance:

- `connected` - Returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is connected or not.
- `status` - Returns the current status of the web3auth instance.
- `provider` - Returns the currently connected provider to the web3auth instance.
- `connectedAdapterName` - Returns the currently connected provider to the web3auth instance.

Finally, with the Wallet Services Plugin, you can enable additional functionalities like:

- `initiateTopup()` - Initiate Topup for the user.
- `showWalletConnectScanner()` - Show WalletConnect QR Code Scanner.

## Logging in the User

#### `connect()`

You can show the modal in the browser by calling `connect()` function on `web3auth` instance. Your
user can choose their preferred login method and access your application.

```javascript
await web3auth.connect();
```

#### Returns

```tsx
connect(): Promise<IProvider | null>;
```

- On successful login, the `connect()` function returns a `IProvider` instance. This instance
  contains the respective provider corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this
  provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.
- On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

:::tip

Read more about connecting your users with the selected blockchain in the
[Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/pnp/web/providers).

### Check if the user is connected

#### `connected`

You can check if the user is connected to the blockchain by calling the `connected` method on the
`web3auth` instance. This property method a `boolean` value.

```javascript
const isConnected = web3auth.connected;
```

#### Returns

```tsx
connected: boolean;
```

:::tip

If you're using the `uxMode: "redirect"` option within your configuration, you need to check this
event to handle the logging in implicitly. This is because, when redirected to a different
application, the app state is not updated as per the login status.

Using this method, you can check if the user is connected and update the app state accordingly
within the constructor.

:::

### Check which adapter is connected

#### `connectedAdapterName`

This function gives you the name of the connected adapter. This can be used to check which adapter
is connected to the user.

```javascript
const adapter = web3auth.connectedAdapterName;
```

#### Returns

```javascript
connectedAdapterName: WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE | null;

export type WALLET_ADAPTER_TYPE = (typeof WALLET_ADAPTERS)[keyof typeof WALLET_ADAPTERS];

export const WALLET_ADAPTERS = {
  ...EVM_ADAPTERS,
  ...SOLANA_ADAPTERS,
};
export const SOLANA_ADAPTERS = {
  TORUS_SOLANA: "torus-solana",
  PHANTOM: "phantom",
  SOLFLARE: "solflare",
  ...MULTI_CHAIN_ADAPTERS,
};

export const EVM_ADAPTERS = {
  TORUS_EVM: "torus-evm",
  METAMASK: "metamask",
  COINBASE: "coinbase",
  ...MULTI_CHAIN_ADAPTERS,
};
export const MULTI_CHAIN_ADAPTERS = {
  OPENLOGIN: "openlogin",
  WALLET_CONNECT_V2: "wallet-connect-v2",
  SFA: "sfa",
};
```

- If a user is connected, it will return the name of the adapter via which the login has happened.
- If connecting via MIPD (EIP6163) in default evm/ solana adapters, it will return the name of the
  wallet connected.
- If no user is connected, this function will return a `null` value.

### Get the connected provider

#### `provider`

Returns the private key provider connected to the `web3auth` instance.

#### Returns

```js
provider: IProvider | null;
```

- If a user is connected, it will return the provider instance connected to the user.
- If no user is connected, however, the initialisation of the `web3auth` instance is done, it will
  return the provider instance, however the provider cannot be used for any operations.
- If no user is connected and the `web3auth` instance is not initialised, it will return a `null`
  value.

:::note

To know more in-depth about providers, have a look at the
[Providers reference](/sdk/pnp/web/providers).

### Know the current status of the instance

#### `status`

Returns the current status of the `web3auth` instance.

```javascript
const status = web3auth.status;
```
