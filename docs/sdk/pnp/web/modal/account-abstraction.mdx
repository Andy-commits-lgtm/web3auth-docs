## Installation

<AccountAbstractionProviderInstallation />

## Configure

When instantiating the Account Abstraction Provider, you can pass configuration objects to the
constructor. These configuration options allow you to select the desired Account Abstraction (AA)
provider, as well as configure the bundler and paymaster, giving you flexibility and control over
the provider.

Please note this is the important step for setting the Web3Auth account abstraction provider.

## Configure Smart Account Provider

<ConfigureSmartAccountProvider />

## Configure Bundler

<ConfigureBundler />

## Configure Paymaster

You can configure the paymaster of your choice to sponsor gas fees for your users, along with the
paymaster context. The paymaster context lets you set additional parameters, such as choosing the
token for ERC-20 paymasters, defining gas policies, and more.

### Sponsored Paymaster

<ConfigureSponsoredPaymaster />

### ERC-20 Paymaster

<ConfigureERC20Paymaster />

## Set up

Once you have configured your AccountAbstractionProvider, you can now plug it in your Web3Auth Modal
instance. If you are also using the external wallets, you can define whether you want to use the
AccountAbstractionProvider, or EthereumPrivateKeyProvider by setting the `useAAWithExternalWallet`
in `Web3AuthOptions`.

### Configure Web3Auth Instance

<AAModalSetup />

### Configure Signer

<ConfigureSigners />

## Smart Account Address

<SmartAccountAddress />

## Send Transaction

<SmartAccountSendTransaction />
