## Cocoapods

## Swift Package Manager

If you are using the Swift Package Manager, open the following menu item in Xcode:

`File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`

In the Choose Package Repository prompt add this url: `https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-swift-sdk`

## Configuration

In order to use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth `ClientId` and which `Network` to run it.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), create or open an existing Web3Auth project and copy your Client ID, which is
  the `ClientId`.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
