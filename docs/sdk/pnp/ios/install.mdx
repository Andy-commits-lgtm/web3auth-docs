## Cocoapods

```sh
pod 'Web3Auth', '~> 6.0.1'
```

## Swift Package Manager

If you are using the Swift Package Manager, open the following menu item in Xcode:

`File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`

In the Choose Package Repository prompt add this url:

```sh
https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk/releases/tag/6.0.1
```

## Configuration

In order to use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth `ClientId` and which `Network` to run it.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), create or open an existing Web3Auth project and copy your Client ID, which is
  the `ClientId`.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
