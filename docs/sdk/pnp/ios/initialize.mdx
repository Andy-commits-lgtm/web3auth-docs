After installation, the next step to use Web3Auth is to initialize the SDK. However, the initialization can be done in two ways,

- [Creating `Web3Auth.plist`](#creating-web3authplist)
- [Using `Web3Auth` instance](#using-web3auth-instance)

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you need to pass on different parameters according to the preference of your project.
Additionally, Whitelabeling and Custom Authentication have to be configured within this step, if you wish to customize your Web3Auth Instance.

## Creating `Web3Auth.plist`

### Setup `Web3Auth.plist`

In your application bundle add a plist file named `Web3Auth.plist` with the following information:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>ClientId</key>
    <string>YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID</string>
  <key>Network</key>
  <string>sapphire_mainnet | sapphire_devnet | mainnet | cyan | aqua | testnet</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

When you have a Web3Auth.plist and have specified your Web3Auth configuration there, you can simply construct your Web3Auth instance with

```swift
import Web3Auth

let web3auth = Web3Auth()
```

## Using `Web3Auth` instance

If you don't want to create a plist file and want to use optional configuration parameters, you can construct the Web3Auth instance with

```swift
import Web3Auth

let web3auth = Web3Auth(W3AInitParams(
  clientId: "<your clientId>",
  network: .sapphire_mainnet,
))
```

### `W3AInitParams` object

The `Web3Auth` constructor takes an object called `W3AInitParams` as input. Below are the available fields of the `W3AInitParams` object.

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                                                         |

| `loginConfig?`    | Login config for the custom verifiers. It takes Dictonary of `[String: W3ALoginConfig]` as a value.                                                                 |
| `useCoreKitKey?`  | Use CoreKit Key to get core kit key. It's an optional field with default value as `false`.                                                                          |
| `chainNamespace?` | Chain Namespace [`eip155` and `solana`]. It takes `ChainNamespace` as a value.                                                                                      |
| `mfaSettings?`    | Allows developers to configure the Mfa settings for authentication. It takes `MfaSettings` as a value.                                                              |
| `sessionTime?`    | It allows developers to configure the session management time. Session Time is in seconds, default is 86400 seconds which is 1 day. `sessionTime` can be max 7 days |
