After installation, the next step to using Web3Auth Self Host is to Initialize the SDK. The Initialization takes a few steps, including initiating the
tKey SDK with the service provider and modules.

- [Configuration of Service Provider](#configuring-service-provider)
- [Instantiation of tKey](#instantiating-tkey)
- [Initialisation of Service Provider](#initialising-service-provider)

:::note

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you must pass on different parameters according to the need of your project.

## Understanding the tKey Flow

---

The tKey SDK depends upon the Service Provider, Storage Layer and Modules to work as an off chain multi sig infrastructure working within your app.

- The [**Service Provider**](./service-provider) helps with the authentication and identification of the user using their social logins and giving the
  an easy way of account retreival.
- The [**Storage Layer**](./storage-layer) refers to the Metadata Storage, which is used to store the metadata information of the shares generated by
  the tKey SDK.
  > You don't need to worry about this while using the `@tkey/default` package
- The [**Modules**](./modules) are the various functionalities that can be added to the tKey SDK, tkey enhance the storage and usage of different
  shares generated in a way it is most suitable for your project.

  We have 3 types of modules available right now:

  - [**Default Modules**](./modules/#default-modules): Modules needed for the basic operations of the tKey SDK.
  - [**Storage Modules**](./modules/#storage-modules): Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage.
  - [**Recovery Modules**](./modules/#recovery-modules): Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to
    their device/storage or needs additional security.
  - [**Additional Modules**](./modules/#additional-modules): These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing
    private keys or seedphrases.

#### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the private key. By default, the number is set to `2` which means that at least
two shares are required to reconstruct the private key. This is done to ensure that the private key is not compromised even if one of the shares is
compromised.

Apart from this, the tKey SDK internally has multiple modes of operation, which are as follows:

- **Read mode:** This happens when atleast 1 share is available to the tKey SDK. In this mode, the tKey SDK can only read the metadata information of
  the share currently available to it, alongside the public data of the other shares.
- **Write mode:** This happens when 2 or more shares are available to the tKey SDK. Please note that the threshold set by the dApp might change this
  number required. Basically once the key threshold is reached, the tKey SDK can write the metadata information of the shares and modify them
  according to the need of the user.

:::info

The initialisation of tKey puts the SDK into Read Mode. This is because the tKey SDK is initialised with only 1 share, ie. the Share A, using the
Service Provider.

## Configuring Service Provider

---

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share A**](/sdk/self-host), i.e. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider via
their authentication flows. This share in our [key infrastructure](/overview/key-management/) refers to the social login aspect, where we associate a
private key share with the user's social login, enabling the seamless login experience.

In the Web3Auth Self Host setup, you have to use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which basically implements Web3Auth's
Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

:::note

This is automatically installed for you once you install the `@tkey/default` package.

:::

### Parameters

<ServiceProviderArg />

### Example

<ServiceProviderExample />

## Configuring Modules

---

<ModulesDescription />

### Example

<ModulesExample />

## Instantiating tKey

---

#### Import the `ThresholdKey` class from `@tkey/default`

```javascript
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/default";
```

#### Assign the `ThresholdKey` class to a variable

```javascript
const tKey = new ThresholdKey(TKeyArgs);
```

This ThresholdKey constructor takes an object with `TKeyArgs` as input.

### Parameters

<TKeyArgs />

### Example

<TKeyInstanceExample />

## Initializing Service Provider

---

You need to initialize your Service Provider within your constructor function so as to use it while logging your user in through the social accounts.
This is done by calling the `init()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```ts
tKey.serviceProvider.init(initParams);
```

### Parameters

#### `initParams`

The `init` function in TorusServiceProvider accepts the following parameters:

<InitParams />

### Example

```js
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init();
```
