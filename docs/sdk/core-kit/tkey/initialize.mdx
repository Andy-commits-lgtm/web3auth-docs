After installation, the next step to using Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK is to Initialize the SDK. The Initialization takes a few steps, including
initiating the tKey SDK with the service provider and modules.

- [Configuration of Service Provider](#configuring-service-provider)
- [Instantiation of tKey](#instantiating-tkey)
- [Initialisation of Service Provider](#initialising-service-provider)

:::note

Please note that these are the most critical steps where you must pass on different parameters according to the need of your project.

## Configuring Service Provider

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share A**](/sdk/core-kit/tkey), i.e. the private key share managed by a wallet service provider
via their authentication flows. This share in our [key infrastructure](/infrastructure/key-management/) refers to the social login aspect, where we
associate a private key share with the user's social login, enabling the seamless login experience.

In the Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK setup, you have to use the Web3Auth Service Provider (`@tkey/service-provider-torus`), which basically implements
Web3Auth's Social Login feature as a service provider, enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of the shares.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-torus`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-torus)

:::note

This is automatically installed for you once you install the `@tkey/default` package.

:::

### Parameters

<ServiceProviderArg />

### Example

<ServiceProviderExample />

## Configuring Modules

<ModulesDescription />

### Example

<ModulesExample />

## Instantiating tKey

#### Import the `ThresholdKey` class from `@tkey/default`

```javascript
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/default";
```

#### Assign the `ThresholdKey` class to a variable

```javascript
const tKey = new ThresholdKey(TKeyArgs);
```

This ThresholdKey constructor takes an object with `TKeyArgs` as input.

### Parameters

<TKeyArgs />

### Example

<TKeyInstanceExample />

## Initializing Service Provider

You need to initialize your Service Provider within your constructor function so as to use it while logging your user in through the social accounts.
This is done by calling the `init()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```ts
tKey.serviceProvider.init(initParams);
```

### Parameters

#### `initParams`

The `init` function in TorusServiceProvider accepts the following parameters:

<InitParams />

### Example

```js
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).init();
```
