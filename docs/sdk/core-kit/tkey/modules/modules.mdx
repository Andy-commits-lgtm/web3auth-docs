Modules extend the tKey SDK's capability to provide additional functionality for managing your tKey shares. These modules can be used for multiple
purposes, from storing shares to generating password or converting them into a form that can remembered or sent out.

A standard tKey flow looks something like this:

<img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "600px", margin: "20px auto" }} src={Image1} alt="Web3Auth's Private Key - Key Reconstruction" />

Out of the multiple modules available, you can choose the module you want to include in your implementation. Here is the list of available modules:

- [**Default Modules**](#default-modules): Modules needed for the basic operations of the tKey SDK.
- [**Storage Modules**](#storage-modules): Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage.
- [**Recovery Modules**](#recovery-modules): Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to their
  device/storage or needs additional security.
- [**Additional Modules**](#additional-modules): These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing private keys
  or seedphrases.
