While installing Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK, we recommend installing the `tkey/default` SDK. This package contains all the needed functionalities of
the `tkey` SDK.

## [`@tkey/default`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/default)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @tkey/default
```

## Adding Modules

Modules extend the tKey SDK's capability to provide additional functionality for managing your tKey shares. Out of the multiple modules available, you
can choose the module you want to include in your implementation. Here is the list of available modules:

### Default Modules (Needed for basic operations)

- **tKey Share Serialization Module [`@tkey/share-serialization`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/share-serialization):** Adds the capability to import/
  export a share from `tKey`.

- **tKey Share Transfer Module [`@tkey/share-transfer`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/share-transfer):** Adds the capability to transfer a share to
  another device.

:::note

These modules are automatically configured for you in the tKey SDK. You don't need to additionally install them.

:::

### Share B (Storage Modules)

Storage Modules are used to store the tKey shares in the user's device storage. You can choose any of the following modules:

- **tKey Web Storage Module [`@tkey/web-storage`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/web-storage):** Adds the capability to add or remove a share from the
  local and file storage.

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install --save @tkey/web-storage
  ```

- **tKey Chrome Storage Module [`@tkey/chrome-storage`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/chrome-storage):** Adds the capability to add or remove a share
  from the chrome extension storage.

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install --save @tkey/chrome-storage
  ```

:::tip

Share Transfer Module can act as a Storage Module as well here.

:::

### Share C (Recovery Modules)

Recovery Modules are used to recover the tKey shares in the case user doesn't have access to their device/storage or needs additional security. You
can choose any of the following modules:

- **tKey Security Questions Module [`@tkey/security-questions`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/security-questions):** Adds the capability to add or remove
  a question and password as a share.

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install --save @tkey/security-questions
  ```

:::tip

Share Serialization Module can act as a Recovery Module as well here.

:::

### Additional Modules

These modules provide extra capability to the tKey SDK, like importing user's existing private keys or seedphrases. You can choose any of the
following modules:

- **tKey Seed Phrase Module [`@tkey/seed-phrase`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/seed-phrase):** Adds the capability to store and use seedphrases on the
  metadata.

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install --save @tkey/seed-phrase
  ```

- **tKey Private Keys Module [`@tkey/private-keys`](/sdk/core-kit/tkey/modules/private-keys):** Adds the capability to store extra private keys on the
  metadata.

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install --save @tkey/private-keys
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Webpack 5 Issues

With the latest version of webpack, you might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing. These dependencies need to be polyfilled
in your application. Furthermore, your app needs to be reconfigured to use them while building the app.

Please check out our **[dedicated troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting/webpack-issues)** for fixing webpack 5 issues.

### Service Worker

A service worker is a scripts that is run by the browser. It does not have any direct relationship with the DOM and provides many out of the box
network-related features. Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK needs a service worker relative to `baseUrl` to capture the auth redirect at `redirectPathName`
path.

For example, while using service worker if `baseUrl` is `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker` then user will be redirected to
`http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect` page after login where service worker will capture the results and send it back to original window
where login was initiated.

:::tip

- Using service worker is optional, but highly recommended. You can skip it by passing `skipSw` param while [initialising tKey](./initialize).

- Service worker is needed if you are using `popup` uxMode within your [Service Provider configuration](./initialize#configuring-service-provider).

- For browsers where service workers are not supported, or in the case you wish to not use service workers, create and serve redirect page (i.e
  `redirect.html` file).

:::

#### Redirect Page

If you don't have to use service worker or `redirect.html` file. You can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount.

For example, if baseUrl is `http://localhost:3000` and `redirectPathName` is `auth` then user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/auth` page
after login where you can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount.

#### Service Worker Setup

- If you're using React, to setup service worker, you need to create a `sw.js` file in your public folder and register it in your `index.html` file.
  You can find more information about it in [this blog](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-service-workers-with-react-27a4c5e2d1a9).

- For Angular, [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started) will be helpful in setting up the service worker.

- For Vue, [this guide](https://www.360learntocode.com/2020/12/how-to-use-and-customize-service-worker-in-vuejs-pwa.html) is a great way to get
  started with service workers.

#### Service Worker Code

You can directly copy the service worker file code from here and paste in your respective folder. You can also find the code in our
[tKey JS Examples (Popup Flow)](/examples?product=Core+Kit&sdk=tKey+JS+SDK).
