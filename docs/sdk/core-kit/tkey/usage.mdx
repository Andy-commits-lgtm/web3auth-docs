import SubVerifierDetails from "@site/src/common/sdk/core-kit/tkey/_sub-verifier-details.mdx";
import ThresholdKey from "@site/src/common/sdk/core-kit/tkey/_threshold-key.mdx";
import TkeyInitParams from "@site/src/common/sdk/core-kit/tkey/_tkey-init-params.mdx";
import TorusLoginResponse from "@site/src/common/sdk/core-kit/tkey/_torus-login-response.mdx";

Once you've installed and successfully instantiated tKey and initialised the service provider in your constructor, you can use it to authenticate your
users and generate their tKey shares. Further, you can use a variety of functions exposed by the tKey SDK and its modules to manage different aspects
of your users' authentication needs.

We'll be talking in depth about the following operations:

- [Logging in the User](#log-in)
- [Getting User Information](#get-user-information)
- [Getting tKey Details](#get-tkey-details)
- [Reconstructing User's Private Key](#reconstruct-private-key)
- [Generating a new Share](#generate-a-new-share)
- [Deleting a Share](#delete-a-share)
- [Using Modules for Further Operations](#using-modules)
- [Making Blockchain Calls](#making-blockchain-calls)

## Log In

The login with the tKey SDK is a two step process. First, you need to trigger the login process by calling the `triggerLogin()` function of the
Service Provider. Following which using the returned information, use the `initialize()` function of the tKey to generate the Threshold Key
corresponding to the user.

However, before starting this process, you need to set up Custom Authentication on your Web3Auth Dashboard. For this, you need

[Create a Verifier](/auth-provider-setup/verifiers) from the **Custom Auth** section of the

[Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) with your desired configuration.

:::tip

If you want to know more about setting up a verifier and how to use it, please refer to the
[Custom Authentication Documentation](/pnp/features/custom-authentication).

### Triggering Login using Service Provider

#### `tKey.serviceProvider.triggerLogin(SubVerifierDetails)`

This is a needed step since this will generate a private key which will be needed by the tKey to generate it's share. This is done by calling the
`triggerLogin()` function within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider`.

<SubVerifierDetails />

:::note additional reading

#### Trigger Login using Aggregate Verifier

#### `triggerAggregateLogin()`

```javascript
await (tKey.serviceProvider as TorusServiceProvider).triggerAggregateLogin(AggregateLoginParams)
```

Takes in the aggregate verifier details as `AggregateLoginParams`.

```ts
interface AggregateLoginParams {
  aggregateVerifierType: AGGREGATE_VERIFIER_TYPE;
  verifierIdentifier: string;
  subVerifierDetailsArray: SubVerifierDetails[];
}
```

:::

### Initializing tKey

#### `tKey.initialize(params?)`

Once you have triggered the login process, you're ready to initialize the tKey. This will generate a Threshold Key corresponding to your login
provider.

#### Parameters

<TkeyInitParams />

### Example

```js
await(tKey.serviceProvider as any).triggerLogin({
  typeOfLogin: "google", // "google","facebook","reddit","discord","twitch", etc.
  verifier: "google-tkey-w3a",
  clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
});
await tKey.initialize();
```

## Get User Information

```ts
triggerLogin(params: SubVerifierDetails): Promise<TorusLoginResponse>;
```

The tKey Service Provider returns a `TorusLoginResponse` object which contains the user's information and details about the login. You can access the
`userInfo` property within it to get the user details from the login provider.

<TorusLoginResponse />

```js title="Example"
const loginResponse = await(tKey.serviceProvider as any).triggerLogin({
  typeOfLogin: "google", // "google","facebook","reddit","discord","twitch", etc.
  verifier: "google-tkey-w3a",
  clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
});
const user = loginResponse.userInfo;
console.log("User Details: ", user);
```

## Get tKey Details

#### `tKey.getKeyDetails()`

The function `getKeyDetails()` returns the details of the keys present generated for the specific user. This includes the public key X & Y of the
user, alongside the shares details and the threshold.

### Sample Key Details Return

```ts
[
  {
    pubKey: {
      x: "471dbccd7e55eb2d24..329b8174f2339e516a3d1728d",
      y: "3f93da3597ded482fc..b23c5c79011a3deb8ccf8bf50",
    },
    requiredShares: -9,
    threshold: 2,
    totalShares: 11,
    shareDescriptions: {
      "1": [
        '{"module":"webStorage","userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","dateAdded":1671429485524}',

        '{"module":"webStorage","userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","dateAdded":1671454332687}',

      ],
      "94da7ea9b8680ea13d..1de31915c54c1cfa055134308969088": [
        '{"module":"webStorage","userAgent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","dateAdded":1671424397242}',
      ],
      "9b29f5c69bdcc4c79b..8c573e3001d72dc7a42866e88272866": [
        '{"module":"securityQuestions","questions":"whats your password?","dateAdded":1671424430842}',
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

From here, you can know whether the user key can be reconstructed or not.

- If the `requiredShares` is greater than 0, then the key cannot be reconstructed, because this means that the user has not yet generated enough
  shares to meet the threshold.
- Once the `requiredShares` is 0 or less than that, then the key can be reconstructed, and the user can use the shares to generate the private key and
  make further operations on the tKey and manipulate their keys.

```ts title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  console.log("All shares are present, you can reconstruct your private key and do operations on the tKey");
} else {
  console.log("You need to generate more shares to reconstruct your private key");
}
```

## Reconstruct Private Key

#### `tKey.reconstructKey()`

The function `reconstructKey()` reconstructs the private key of the user from the shares generated. This function returns the private key of the user
once the threshold has been met.

```ts
reconstructKey(_reconstructKeyMiddleware?: boolean): Promise<ReconstructedKeyResult>;

export type ReconstructedKeyResult = {
    privKey: BN;
    seedPhrase?: BN[];
    allKeys?: BN[];
};
```

```ts title="Example"
const { requiredShares } = tKey.getKeyDetails();
if (requiredShares <= 0) {
  const reconstructedKeyResult = await tKey.reconstructKey();
  const privateKey = reconstructedKeyResult?.privKey.toString("hex"));
  console.log("Private Key: ", privateKey);
}
```

## Generate a New Share

#### `tKey.generateNewShare()`

The function `generateNewShare()` generates a new share on the same threshold set by the user. This function returns the new share generated.

```ts
generateNewShare(): Promise<GenerateNewShareResult>;

export type GenerateNewShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
    newShareIndex: BN;
};
```

```ts title="Example"
const shareStore = await tKey.generateNewShare();
await(tKey.modules.webStorage as WebStorageModule).storeDeviceShare(shareStore.newShareStores[1]);
console.log("New Share Stored on the Browser Local Storage: ", shareStore.newShareIndex.toString());
```

## Delete a Share

#### `tKey.deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString)`

The function `deleteShare()` deletes a share from the user's shares. This function returns the updated shareStore after the share has been deleted.

```ts
deleteShare(shareIndex: BNString): Promise<DeleteShareResult>;

export type DeleteShareResult = {
    newShareStores: ShareStoreMap;
};
```

```ts title="Example"
const shareStore = await tKey.deleteShare(previousShareIndex);
console.log("Share has been deleted", shareStore);
```

## Using Modules

For making advanced operations on tKey and to manipulate the keys, you can use the modules provided by tKey. As mentioned in the
[initialisation](./initialize) section, you need to configure the modules beforehand to make it work with tKey. Once that is done, the instance of the
respective module is available within your tKey instance and can be used for further operations.

:::tip

Checkout the [Modules](./modules) section where we have listed all the available modules alongside the functions that can be used within them.

## Making Blockchain Calls

Once you have generated the private key, you can use it to make blockchain calls. The key generated by tKey is of type `secp256k1`, which is
compatible with EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and many others that use the same curve. However, you can also convert this key into
other curves and utilize it. For example, we have a dedicated package for converting this module to the `ed25519` curve for usage in Solana and other
blockchains that use this curve.

In addition to that, we have dedicated provider packages for EVM and Solana Blockchain libraries. You can check out their respective documentation
here:

- Getting a Ethereum Provider from tKey: [Ethereum Provider](/sdk/helper-sdks/providers/evm#getting-a-provider-from-any-secp256k1-private-key)
- Getting a Solana Provider from tKey: [Solana Provider](/sdk/pnp/web/providers/solana#getting-a-provider-from-any-secp256k1-private-key)

:::tip

You can checkout our [Connect Blockchain](/connect-blockchain) documentation which has a detailed guide on how to connect to major blockchains out
there.
