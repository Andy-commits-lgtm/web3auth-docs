## [`@web3auth/single-factor-auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/single-factor-auth)

Web3Auth's `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK is a simple and easy to use SDK, which helps you implement the Web3Auth without redirection in a single
key pair flow.

With the Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDKs you can easily and quickly authenticate users and reconstruct their private key. Web3Auth Plug and Play Web
SDK redirects users to a Web3Auth hosted screen (i.e. http://app.openlogin.com). This flow is great for most use cases. Still, sometimes you may want
to customize the authentication flow such that you can have more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process (i.e. to avoid the
redirection). This can be achieved through this new `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK, where in now, you'll be able to use Web3Auth and avoid the
redirection to openlogin hosted screens.

:::info This SDK gives you semi custodial keys

The `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK gives you the simplest flow for onboarding a user with Web3Auth. The user just needs to click on the login
button, connect to their favourite social account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like email passwordless, biometric authentication etc., and a
private key is generated for them. This flow has a 1/1 Key Share setup and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth Network key shares is provided directly to
your app, and reconstructed within it.

This flow is still non custodial since the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the key shares. However, one can
claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider, since this is directly generated using credentials provided by them.

Hence we can call this flow a semi-custodial flow.

## Installation

---

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
