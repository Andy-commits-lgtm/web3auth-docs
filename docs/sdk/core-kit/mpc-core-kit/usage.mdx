Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`, you can use it to authenticate your users. Further, you can use the native
provider given by Web3Auth to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.

Natively, the instance of `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit` (referred to as `coreKitInstance` in our examples) returns the following functions:

Authentication Functions:

- `connect()` - Logs in the User.
- `logout()` - Logs out the User.
- `handleRedirectResult()` - Handles the redirect result while logging in the User, while in redirect mode

Backup Share Functions:

- `exportBackupShare()` - Exports the Backup Mnemonic Share.
- `inputBackupShare()` - Inputs the Backup Mnemonic Share to recover the User's account.

Security Question Functions:

- `addSecurityQuestionShare()` - Adds a Security Question Share to the User's account.
- `recoverSecurityQuestionShare()` - Recovers the User's account using the Security Question Share.
- `changeSecurityQuestionShare()` - Changes the Security Question Share of the User's account.
- `deleteSecurityQuestionShare()` - Deletes the Security Question Share of the User's account.

User Functions:

- `getUserInfo()` - Returns the User's information received from the ID Token.
- `getKeyDetails()` - Returns the User's Key Details.
- `commitChanges()` - Commits the changes made to the User's account while in manual sync mode.
- `CRITICAL_resetAccount()` - Resets the User's account. This function is only to be used in case of emergencies, when the user is unable to recover
  their account. This deletes all the history of the previous key and the funds/ assets associated with it.

## Logging in your User

#### `connect(params: LoginParams): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;`

To login a user in the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit SDK, you need to call `connect()` function. The function takes in the following parameters:

| Variable      | Type     | Description      | Mandatory |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| `loginParams` | `object` | Login Parameters | Yes       |

:::tip

Checkout the [Authentication Section](./authentication) to know more about the `loginParams` object.

:::

#### Returns

```tsx
connect(loginParams: LoginParams): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>
```

On successful login, the `connect()` function returns a `SafeEventEmitterProvider` instance. This instance contains the respective provider
corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this provider to connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

#### Example

```tsx
const provider = await coreKitInstance.connect({
  subVerifierDetails: {
    typeOfLogin: "google",
    verifier: "google-tkey-w3a",
    clientId: "774338308167-q463s7kpvja16l4l0kko3nb925ikds2p.apps.googleusercontent.com",
  },
});
```

## Logging out the User

#### `logout(): Promise<void>;`

Disconnect the user's connected wallet/ provider and log them out of the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit SDK.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.logout();
```

## Handle Redirect Result

#### `handleRedirectResult(): Promise<SafeEventEmitterProvider | null>;`

While using the redirect mode, you need to handle the redirect result in your application. This can be done by calling the `handleRedirectResult()`
method of the `web3auth` instance, within the constructor of the component where you want to handle the redirect result.

If your URL anchor contains `#state`, then the `handleRedirectResult()` method should be be called, since that is where the redirect result,
containing the `idToken` is returned from the login provider.

#### Example

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const submitRedirectResult = async () => {
    try {
      const provider = await coreKitInstance?.handleRedirectResult();
      if (provider) setProvider(provider);
    } catch (error) {
      if ((error as Error).message === "required more shares") {
        uiConsole("first triggered", coreKitInstance);
        recoverAccount();
      }
    }
  }
  if (coreKitInstance && window.location.hash.includes("#state")) {
    submitRedirectResult();
  }
}, [coreKitInstance]);
```

:::note

For the popup flow, the service worker is needed to handle it properly. Please have a look at the [installation page](./install) to know how to set up
the service worker for your application.

## Export Backup Share

#### `exportBackupShare(): Promise<string>;`

Returns the Backup Mnemonic Share, which can be used to recover the User's account on a different device than they have logged in previously.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.exportBackupShare();
```

## Input Backup Share

#### `inputBackupShare(shareMnemonic: string): Promise<void>;`

Inputs the Backup Mnemonic Share to recover the User's account.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.inputBackupShare(seedPhrase);
```

## Add Security Question Share

#### `addSecurityQuestionShare(question: string, password: string): Promise<void>;`

Creates a security question share for your to easily recover user's account. Since this share can take any question and password, you can innovatively
use this to create any flow for your users to recover their account. From a general password login to using mobile OTP based login and associating a
certain parameter on successful authentication, you can use this share to create any flow you want.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.addSecurityQuestionShare("What is your password?", password);
```

## Recover Security Question Share

#### `recoverSecurityQuestionShare(question: string, password: string): Promise<void>;`

Recover the User's account using the Security Question Share.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.recoverSecurityQuestionShare("What is your password?", password);
```

## Change Security Question Share

#### `changeSecurityQuestionShare(question: string, password: string): Promise<void>;`

Changes the Security Question Share of the User's account. This helps you change the password if the user has lost it somehow. However, this function
can only be used if the user has already logged in within the application while meeting the minimum share threshold.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.changeSecurityQuestionShare("What is your password?", password);
```

## Delete Security Question Share

#### `deleteSecurityQuestionShare(question: string): Promise<void>;`

Deletes the Security Question Share of the User's account. This function can only be used if the user has already logged in within the application
while meeting the minimum share threshold.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.deleteSecurityQuestionShare("What is your password?");
```

## Get User Info

#### `getUserInfo(): UserInfo;`

Returns the User's information received from the ID Token.

#### Returns

This function returns the following parameters in the form of an object:

```tsx
type UserInfo = {
  email: string;
  name: string;
  profileImage: string;
  aggregateVerifier?: string;
  verifier: string;
  verifierId: string;
  typeOfLogin: LOGIN_TYPE;
  ref?: string;
  registerOnly?: boolean;
  extraVerifierParams?: WebAuthnExtraParams;
  accessToken: string;
  idToken?: string;
  ref?: string;
  extraParams?: string;
  extraParamsPassed?: string;
  state: TorusGenericObject;
};
```

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.getUserInfo();
```

## Get Key Details

#### `getKeyDetails(): KeyDetails;`

Returns the details of how the user's key is managed by the MPC Core Kit.

#### Returns

This function returns the following parameters in the form of an object:

```tsx
type KeyDetails = {
  pubKey: Point;
  requiredShares: number;
  threshold: number;
  totalShares: number;
  shareDescriptions: ShareDescriptionMap;
};
```

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.getKeyDetails();
```

## Commit Changes

#### `commitChanges(): Promise<void>;`

Sync the local changes made to the User's account with the web3auth metadata server. This function is only to be used while in manual sync mode.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.commitChanges();
```

## Reset Account (CRITICAL)

#### `CRITICAL_resetAccount(): Promise<void>;`

Can be used to reset user's account in case of emergencies, when the user is unable to recover their account. This deletes all the history of the
previous key and the funds/ assets associated with it.

#### Example

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.CRITICAL_resetAccount();
```
