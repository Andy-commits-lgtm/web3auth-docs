import ServiceWorkerCode from "@site/src/common/sdk/core-kit/tkey/_sw-js.mdx";

## [`@web3auth/mpc-core-kit`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/mpc-core-kit)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/mpc-core-kit
```

## Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.

### Service Worker

A service worker is a scripts that is run by the browser. It does not have any direct relationship with the DOM and provides many out of the box
network-related features. Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK needs a service worker relative to `baseUrl` to capture the auth redirect at `redirectPathName`
path.

For example, while using service worker if `baseUrl` is `http://localhost:3000/serviceworker` then user will be redirected to
`http://localhost:3000/serviceworker/redirect` page after login where service worker will capture the results and send it back to original window
where login was initiated.

:::tip

- Using service worker is required only in the popup flow.

- Service worker is needed if you are using `popup` uxMode within your [Service Provider configuration](./initialize#configuring-service-provider).

- For browsers where service workers are not supported, or in the case you wish to not use service workers, create and serve redirect page (i.e
  `redirect.html` file).

:::

#### Redirect Page

If you don't have to use service worker or `redirect.html` file. You can get login result by calling `handleRedirectResult()` on redirected page
mount.

For example, if baseUrl is `http://localhost:3000` and `redirectPathName` is `auth` then user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/auth` page
after login where you can get login result by calling `getRedirectResult` on redirected page mount.

#### Service Worker Setup

- If you're using React, to setup service worker, you need to create a `sw.js` file in your public folder and register it in your `index.html` file.
  You can find more information about it in [this blog](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-service-workers-with-react-27a4c5e2d1a9).

- For Angular, [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started) will be helpful in setting up the service worker.

- For Vue, [this guide](https://www.360learntocode.com/2020/12/how-to-use-and-customize-service-worker-in-vuejs-pwa.html) is a great way to get
  started with service workers.

#### Service Worker Code

You can directly copy the service worker file code from here and paste in your respective folder. You can also find the code in our
[MPC Core Kit Example (Popup Flow)](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/blob/main/mpc-core-kit/mpc-core-kit-react-popup-example/src/App.tsx).
