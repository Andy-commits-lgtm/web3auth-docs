Web3Auth's `@web3auth/mpc-core-kit` SDK is a simple and easy to use SDK, which helps you implement the Web3Auth MPC Features, while giving you the
flexibility to customize the UI and UX of the authentication process. It is essentially a wrapper around the tKey MPC SDK, which is the core
implementation of Web3Auth MPC.

:::caution

This SDK is production ready, however, this works in the 2/2 recovery flow. This means that the backup/ recovery shares are copies of the device
share, making the user hold only one of the shares is any case.

Web3Auth MPC Core Kit Web SDK is designed in a way to make it easier for you to integrate Web3Auth MPC. Without the social login share, it is not
possible for you to sign signatures. Hence, the 2/2 flow is allows you the same experience as a 2/3 or 2/4 flow. You can generate as many backup
shares as you want, but internally, they will be copies of the device share.

If you require the 2/3 flow for your application, you need to directly integrate the [tKey MPC SDK](/content-hub/guides/tkey-mpc). Here, there is one
additional share which you can ask the user to safe gaurd, however the experience of using it will be the same. We are working on adding more features
to this SDK and will be releasing them in the consecutive updates.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScipt
- Supports all major JavaScript Frameworks, Libraries and Bundlers

## Understanding the Web3Auth MPC Core Kit Web SDK

With the Web3Auth infrastructure, your key is divided into multiple parts and stored across your devices and our Auth Network. This ensures that your
key is always available and never stored in a single place. While in the traditional Web3Auth SDK, your key was dynamically reconstructed in the
frontend using threshold signatures, with the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi Party Computation) architecture, it is **never reconstructed**. Instead, these
partial keys are stored across different locations, and your device is used to make partial signatures for your message/ transaction. These are
finally returned to the frontend where using TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme), these signatures are combined to make a final signature. You can use
this finally signed message/transaction to make a transaction on the blockchain.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth
network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous benefits, especially in terms of security.

As you can notice in this diagram above, the final output, i.e., the User's TSS Account, is generated in multiple stages within the infrastructure.
Since this is a TSS- MPC based infrastructure, you don't get back a private key, but signatures that can be used to make transactions on the
blockchain. Let's understand each of these stages in detail.

### Factors

#### Social Login Factor

This is the primary way for a user to access their account. This step involves authentication using a user's preferred social login provider. The
idToken received from the social login provider here is passed to the Web3Auth Auth Network to generate the TSS Shares in the Nodes. By default, these
nodes have a threshold of 3/5 which can be customized according to requirements. When a user logs in, the Auth Network generates signatures
corresponding to the TSS Shares in the nodes and returns them to the user's end. These signatures are then used alongside other shares to generate the
final TSS Account signatures.

#### Device Factor

This is the second factor used to access the user's account. This step involves the generation of a TSS Share on the user's device and using that to
generate a final signature for the TSS Account alongside the social login factor. This ensures the user logs in using their trusted device and
maintains a proper non-custodial setup.

#### Backup Factor

A user has a choice to generate as many backup factors as needed to access their account. This step involves the generation of a TSS Share on the
user's end and storing them in whichever location they prefer. This share can be used similarly to the device share to generate a final signature for
the TSS Account alongside the social login and/or device factors.

### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to generate a final signature for the TSS Account. This threshold, by default, is set to 3/5 on
the Auth Network and 2/3 for the user's device front. This ensures high availability and ease of access on both ends alongside optimum security. Both
these thresholds can be customized according to the requirements.

### Components of a Factor

#### TSS Shares

The TSS Shares are the main component needed for the generation of the final working signature of the user. These shares are generated using
distributed key generation and are stored in the Auth Network and the user's device. Since these shares are generated using MPC, they are **never
reconstructed** and always stay decentralized and secure.

#### Metadata Key & Shares

The Metadata Key closely mimics the storage of the TSS Key and Shares. The only difference is that the metadata key is always reconstructed and used
for its encryption/decryption capabilities. It utilizes basic Shamir's Secret Sharing and is initially generated on a users' frontend. The metadata
key ensures that the infrastructure is backward compatible with the existing Web3Auth architecture, which utilizes SSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing) as
the main key reconstruction scheme.

#### Factor Keys

To enable refresh, deletion, and rotational capabilities on the `tssKey`, we also introduce **factorKeys**. Factor Keys are randomly generated keys
unique to each factor-generated user's device and backups, like users' phones, chrome extension, on their cloud, assisting third parties, etc.

As shares to the TSS Key and/or Metadata Key may rotate, Factor Keys allow a consistent secret to being saved in these different locations.

## Helper SDKs

### Common Types and Interfaces

#### [`@web3auth/base`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base)

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with Typescript.
