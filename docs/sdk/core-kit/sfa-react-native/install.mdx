## Selecting your Workflow

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

### Expo Managed Workflow

Your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app. Developers build managed workflow apps
using `expo-cli` on their computer and a development client on their mobile devices. Managed workflows apps typically use one or more Expo services,
such as push notifications, build, and updates.

:::warning Note

The React Native PnP SDK V4 is not compatible with the "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section for more on this. Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has installed,
before running `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

:::

### Bare React Native Workflow

Your Bare React Native app is entirely built on your own machine. In this workflow, the developer has complete control, along with the complexity that
comes with that. Configuration with `app.json` / `app.config.js` is mostly not supported in this context; instead, you will need to configure each native
project directly with Swift/Kotlin native modules. Check out the [troubleshooting section](/docs/sdk/pnp/react-native/install#troubleshooting) for fixing common issues.

:::tip

You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/).

## Installation

#### [`@web3auth/single-factor-auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/single-factor-auth)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```



## [`@web3auth/single-factor-auth`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/single-factor-auth)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth
```

## Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you
need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
