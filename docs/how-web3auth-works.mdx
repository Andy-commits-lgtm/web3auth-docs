This page covers the different aspects of what happens when you use Web3Auth. This document will give you the user and the developer perspective on
the architectural aspect of Web3Auth. It is a good idea to read this before you start using Web3Auth.

## Replacing Seed Phrases with Multi Factor Keys

---

Today's Key Management standard is done via seed phrases, 12 or 24 word representations of keys that can be written down or stored in various ways.
While technically simple, it's far from perfect; new users take anywhere from 10-15 minutes to onboard into any new application, losses are rampant
due to misplaced or compromised seed phrases, and today's standard leaves much to be desired.

With Web3Auth, users handle keys similar to a multi-factor account, where they use their OAuth login, devices, and other factors to manage their key
pairs. The full cryptographic private keys of users are not recorded anywhere on the Key Infrastructure system, even on any of our databases as well
as participating nodes.

## High Level Architecture

---

The Web3Auth SDK lives solely on the user/application’s front-end client and handles the interactions between OAuth providers and the Auth Network.

:::note

As you can see, the integrated application or wallet ultimately ends up with a private key specific to their client ID. In this way, it is important
to note that **Web3Auth is not a Wallet, it is Wallet Infrastructure that is plugged into dApps or Wallets.**

:::

For the developer, the integration is as simple as just initialising the Web3Auth SDKs and setting up the required configuration. The SDK is
integrated into either a website application or mobile/native app which embeds the login functionality. The developer can then use the SDK to
authenticate users by calling the connect function. This function can be triggered by a simple login button or by a user action.

##### How Web3Auth interacts flow-wise with your wallet/application

Once the user starts the process:

1. User is redirected to our portal (`app.openlogin.com`)
2. Our portal, `app.openlogin.com`, then handles the initial process of login
3. User is redirected to login/OAuth provider and carries out the authentication process with respect to their auth provider
4. User is redirected back to our portal, which then handles the reconstruction of the user’s key
5. Finally, once the user is successfully authenticated, they are redirected back to application, with derived key specific to the application/wallet

## How Web3Auth Key Generation works

---

The Web3Auth [Key Management Infrastructure](/infrastructure/key-management/) eliminates the exposure of seed phrases to users by splitting up the
private key into different key shares representing a user's web of trust. The diagram shows below how user's private key is being split up. Using the
concept of Threshold Cryptography (with Shamir Secret Sharing), users only need a minimum of 2 out of n<sup>th</sup> number of keyshares to get back
their private key. This allow users to have control over their key and at the same time prevent account loss from a single point of failure (ie, they
can lose their device and still have access to their account). Further to create a social login share, a user has to use the Web3Auth Auth Network,
where the key generation happens through a 5/9 consensus system. This ensures that the keys are always non custodial to Web3Auth, Social Login
Providers or any other party holding a key share.
