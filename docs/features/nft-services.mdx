## NFT Checkout

The NFT Checkout Service is designed to help you enable end to end NFT minting, payments and
delivery services, via a seamless user experience using fiat payments (credit/debit cards, other
payment options).

:::info

We support **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155** contracts on all evm-based networks.

:::

The Web3Auth SDK can launch a checkout window that guides users through the complete payment and
minting process. Once the transaction is complete, the user's wallet will contain the minted NFT,
and they will be redirected back to your site.

Our NFT Checkout Service offers pre-built, customizable UIs for minting and purchasing NFTs. Key
features include:

- **Whitelabel UIs:** Easily integrate and customize the interface to fit your brand.
- **Mint Limit and Pricing:** Set the minting limit and price according to your needs.

## NFT Minting

The NFT Minting API helps you initiate the minting process for specified NFTs, enabling large-scale,
gasless minting through our scalable batch minting infrastructure. This API is perfect for Airdrops,
free mints, or situations where you manage fiat payments independently.

Simply provide the API with the contract details, token ID, and recipient wallet address, and we
will handle the rest. Key features include:

- **Control Over Fiat Payments:** Manage fiat payments independently.
- **Custom Authorization Requirements:** Implement additional authorization measures such as
  whitelisting addresses for minting.
- **Webhook Notifications:** Register webhook endpoints to receive transaction status updates.
- **Gas Fees Covered:** We handle all gas fees for you.
