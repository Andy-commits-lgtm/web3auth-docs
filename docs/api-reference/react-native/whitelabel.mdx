Whitelabeling is not officialy supported in both of the React Native SDKs yet. However currently it can be acheived by running some hacks with the
Expo based SDK. Please consult our developers if you want to use this hack.

The support for whitelabeling on both Expo-based SDK and Bare React Native SDK is being worked on.
