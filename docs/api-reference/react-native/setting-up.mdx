## Requirements

---

For iOS, only iOS 12+ supported since we requires
[ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).

For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Choosing the correct SDK

---

### Bare vs Managed

- Bare workflow means your React Native app or Expo app is entirely built on your own machine. You can customize your app with Swift/Kotlin native
  modules.
- Managed workflow means your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app.
- You can read more about different workflows in https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/.

### [Expo based SDK using managed workflow](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk)

You should use the Expo based SDK with managed workflow if you

- are building an Expo app.

### [Expo based SDK using bare workflow](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-bare-sample)

You should use the Expo based SDK with bare workflow if you

- are building an bare React Native app, or an [ejected](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) Expo app.
- Does not have problem with the work of [integrating](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) the Expo SDK into an existing bare
  workflow app. If auto integration failed the work required to integrate the Expo SDK can be complex and hard to achieve.
- Want to use extra Web3Auth parameters that are not yet implemented in the React Native SDK yet (currently WIP).

### [React Native SDK](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-react-native-sdk)

You should use the React Native SDK if you

- are building an bare React Native app, or an [ejected](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) Expo app.
- are troubled with the integration work of Expo SDK into the existing codebase.
- Do not require the extra Web3Auth parameters that are not yet implemented in the React Native SDK yet (currently WIP).

## Installation

### [Expo based SDK using managed workflow](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk)

Install the `expo-web-browser` package with

```sh
expo install expo-web-browser
```

Install the npm package with

```sh
npm install openlogin-expo-sdk
```

To allow the Expo based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated scheme into `app.json`, like

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "openloginexposdkexampleexpo"
  }
}
```

You may refer to the example app in https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk.

### [Expo based SDK using bare workflow](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-bare-sample)

Follow the instructions on https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/ to install the Expo SDK into your bare React Native app.

Install the `expo-web-browser` package by

```sh
expo install expo-web-browser
```

Follow the extra instructions in https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-web-browser for installing the `expo-web-browser` package.

Install the Expo based SDK with

```sh
npm install openlogin-expo-sdk
```

If you are using iOS, install the iOS dependecies with

```sh
npx pod-install
```

Register the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection into your Android `AndoidManifest.xml` (required) and iOS `Info.plist` (optional).
