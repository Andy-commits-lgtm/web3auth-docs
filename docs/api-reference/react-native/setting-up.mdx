## Introduction

For making hybrid iOS & Android applications using React Native, we have the
[`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk) application.

### Requirements

- For iOS, only iOS 12+ supported since we requires
  [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).

- For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Installation

---

Install the React Native SDK

```sh
npm install @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

### Android

- Perform the native [Android integration steps](/api-reference/android/setting-up).
- For Android, the `redirectUrl` parameter is configurable, and has to be added into the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

### iOS

- Perform the native [iOS integration steps](/api-reference/ios/setting-up).

- Nothing has to be done with the iOS `Info.plist` since the `redirectUrl` is fixed to be `\(bundleId)://auth`, and does not need to be added as a iOS
  Custom URL Scheme.

Register the URL scheme you intended to use for redirection

- Android `AndoidManifest.xml` (required)
- iOS `Info.plist` (optional)

## Initialisation

---

### Create a `Web3Auth` instance

```typescript
import Web3AuthReactNativeSdk, { LoginProvider, Web3AuthNetwork } from "web3auth-react-native-sdk";

await Web3AuthReactNativeSdk.init({
  // Your clientId obtained from Web3Auth dashboard.
  clientId: "BKJ3HmEqVmMHbFeW6E-CVPmdnVrnPhdBEI82kxgBVJGtaS4XlylvAE-1gmsv_Fa1CDj-xIhvTf3Kgd6mTn8nJtw",
  network: Web3AuthNetwork.MAINNET,
  // redirectUrl only applies for Android SDK, it is designated by iOS SDK in iOS, which is \(bundleId)://auth
  redirectUrl: "com.example.web3authreactnativesdk://auth",
});
```

### `Web3AuthOptions` object

The `init()` method on in the Bare React Native SDK and the `Web3Auth` constructor in the Expo based SDK takes an `Web3AuthOptions` object as
argument. The fields of such object are listed below.

| Parameter   | Type                               | Mandatory                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| clientId    | String                             | Yes                          | Your Web3Auth project ID obtained from the Web3Auth dashboard                                                                                                                                   |
| network     | enum of Web3AuthNetwork or Network | Yes                          | Web3Auth network to run on, either MAINNET or TESTNET                                                                                                                                           |
| redirectUrl | String                             | Yes on bare React Native SDK | The redirectUrl that the Web3Auth login flow will use to redirect back to the app. It is not required to be specified in the Expo based SDK since it will be specified in the `login()` method. |

## Example

---

```typescript
import Web3AuthReactNativeSdk, { LoginProvider, Web3AuthNetwork } from "web3auth-react-native-sdk";

React.useEffect(() => {
  Web3AuthReactNativeSdk.init({
    // Your clientId obtained from Web3Auth dashboard.
    clientId: "BKJ3HmEqVmMHbFeW6E-CVPmdnVrnPhdBEI82kxgBVJGtaS4XlylvAE-1gmsv_Fa1CDj-xIhvTf3Kgd6mTn8nJtw",
    // TESTNET is currently broken on iOS.
    network: Web3AuthNetwork.MAINNET,
    // redirectUrl only applies for Android SDK, it is designated by iOS SDK in iOS, which is \(bundleId)://auth
    redirectUrl: "com.example.web3authreactnativesdk://auth",
  })
    .then((result) => console.log(`success: ${result}`))
    .catch((err) => console.log(`error: ${err}`));
}, []);
```
