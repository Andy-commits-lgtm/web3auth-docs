## Requirements

- For iOS, only iOS 12+ supported since we requires
  [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession).

- For Android, Custom Tab support is required.

## Bare vs Managed Workflows

---

- By a bare workflow, we mean that your React Native or Expo app is entirely built on your own machine. You can customize your app with Swift/Kotlin
  native modules.
- By a managed workflow, we mean that your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app.
- You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/).

## Choosing the correct SDK

---

Our SDKs essentially help you use a [Plug and Play Project](/get-started/using-dashboard#plug-and-play) from the Web3Auth Dashboard and sign in your
users natively using your Android or iOS device.

### Web3Auth React Native SDK

#### [`web3auth-react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

You should use the React Native SDK if you

- are building an bare React Native app, or an [ejected](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) Expo app.
- are troubled with the integration work of Expo SDK into the existing codebase.
- Do not require the extra Web3Auth parameters that are not yet implemented in the React Native SDK yet (currently WIP).

### Openlogin Expo SDK

While we migrate our React Native Expo SDK to Web3Auth, you can use our OpenLogin SDK for React Native Expo, which essentially does the same job as
our Web3Auth React Native SDK, for for Expo managed projects.

#### Expo SDK using Managed Workflow

#### [`openlogin-expo-sdk`](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-sdk)

You should use the Expo based SDK with managed workflow if you are building an Expo app.

#### Expo SDK using Bare Workflow

#### [`openlogin-expo-bare-sample`](https://github.com/torusresearch/openlogin-expo-bare-sample)

You should use the Expo based SDK with bare workflow if

- You are building an bare React Native app, or an [ejected](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/) Expo app.
- You don't have problem with the work of [integrating](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) the Expo SDK into an existing bare
  workflow app. If auto integration failed the work required to integrate the Expo SDK can be complex and hard to achieve.
- You want to use extra Web3Auth parameters that are not yet officially implemented in the React Native SDK yet (currently WIP). Please consult our
  developers if you want to adapt such tricks.
