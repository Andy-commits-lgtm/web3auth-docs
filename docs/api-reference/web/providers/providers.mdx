A provider is how libraries like web3 & ethers.js talk to the blockchain. Providers take JSON-RPC requests and return the response. This is normally
done by submitting the request to an HTTP or IPC socket based server. Each adapter in Web3Auth exposes a Provider on successful user authentication.
This provider can be use to interact with wallet or connected chain using RPC calls. Currently, Web3Auth supports providers for both EVM and Solana
chains, which means that any EVM compatible chain & Solana can directly use our native providers can interact with the dApp. You can follow our API
Reference to know more about how to use these providers with thier compatible adapters:

- [EIP1193 (EVM) Providers](/api-reference/web/providers/evm)
- [Solana Providers](/api-reference/web/providers/solana)

## Web3Auth has multichain support

So, we have covered our existing wallet adapters and providers available. What if you want to use a different chain or a wallet?

Here the ability of exposing the user private key comes in handy. Every SDK of Web3Auth has the functionality of exposing the user private key, within
the dApp instance locally. This private key can be utilised by the dApp to interact with the chain.

The small API surface also means Web3Auth is composable - you can combine it with a meta-transaction flows, multisigs, and other cryptographic
protocols. It is easy to build on top of, and generally fits with most other technology stacks, including but not limited to; your flavour scalability
solutions, meta transactions, smart contract wallets, different elliptic curve pairs and even RSA.
