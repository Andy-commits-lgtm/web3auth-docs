Choosing the right Web3Auth product involves a careful analysis of what each option offers. Both our Plug and Play and Core-Kit solutions have unique
features and benefits tailored to meet specific project needs.

## Plug and Play

Web3Auth's **Plug and Play** is designed for efficiency and ease of use, offering predefined UI & UX flows and user-friendly SDKs.

**Key Features:**

- **Ease of Integration:** Requires only the initialization of the Web3Auth SDKs and the setup of necessary configurations.
- **Non Custodial:** By default, the SDKs are non-custodial, meaning that users have complete control over their private keys.
- **Pre Generated UX/UI Flows:** For ease of integration, this SDK offers predefined UI/UX flow, with full whitelabeling options.
- **Wallet Aggregator:** Allows you to integrate multiple existing wallets into your application, alongside social logins, to provide users with a
  seamless login experience of their choice.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Available for Web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity and Unreal environments.

## Core-Kit

The **Core-Kit** provides a more hands-on approach. It allows developers to define and develop their authentication flows, with Web3Auth being
invisible to the end-user.

**Key Features:**

- **Customizable UI & UX:** Enables you to build and maintain your own UI & UX for login and MFA.
- **Owning the Infrastructure:** Enables you to own the key management and the authentication flow.
- **No Redirection:** Unlike PnP, for Core Kit the key management flows are not hosted on `app.openlogin.com`. This means that users will not be
  redirected to a different domain for authentication. All the flows can happen within your application.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Available for Web, React Native, iOS and Android.

## Migrating between SDKs

Whether you're seeking to optimize your current user flows or want to try out new features, migrating from one Web3Auth product to another can be a
powerful way to enhance your application. However, it's crucial to handle migrations properly to ensure security and seamless user experience.

:::caution

Migrations might involve changing the private keys, which can lead to loss of access to the user's account. Please ensure you meet all the
requirements for migrating between SDKs.

:::

### Plug and Play to Core Kit Migration

This is one of the most common migration paths. Usually, developers start with the Web3Auth Plug and Play for low engineering effort and then
transition to Core Kit for a more customized integration.

:::danger

This migration is only possible if you've used custom authentication with your own login verifiers with Plug and Play SDKs. If you're using the
standard authentication flows, the private keys will change in the new integration.

:::

#### To Single Factor Auth (SFA) SDKs

If you're migrating to SFA SDKs, you can directly use the SDK with the same Client Id, alongside authentication and verifier details. Additionally, by
setting the `usePnPKey` flag to `true`, you can get the same key as the Plug and Play SDKs. However, if a user has enabled MFA, they will not be able
to use the SFA SDKs.

#### To tKey JS SDK

If you're migrating to the tKey JS SDK, it is more manual process in total. Firstly, you need to use the same authentication and verifier details as
the plug and play integration, but additionally, you need to create a subkey of the final private key generated by the Plug and Play SDKs. To do this,
you'll need to use the `@toruslabs/openlogin-subkey` and generate a subkey of the private key with your Plug and Play Client ID as a the parameter.

```ts
import { subkey } from "@toruslabs/openlogin-subkey";

subkey(PRIVATE_KEY.padStart(64, "0"), Buffer.from(CLIENT_ID, "base64"));
```

:::info Pre planning Migrations

Ideally, we would recommend you to use the products within the correct configuration to minimise the migration efforts. Ideally, using the Single
Factor Auth SDK before hand and then shifting to tKey SDK works best for most integrations, however pre planning your key requirements while using
Plug and Play SDKs can be helpful.

#### If you're looking to use Core Kit SDKs in the future, planning the use Plug and Play SDKs right now, make sure:

- You're using Custom Authentication with your own login verifiers.
- Set the `useCoreKitKey` flag to `true`

:::

### Core Kit to Plug and Play Migration

This migration typically occurs when developers want to leverage the prebuilt UI/UX of the Plug and Play SDKs for user MFA. Use the same verifier
details from your Core Kit integration in the custom authentication feature of Plug and Play. Set the `useCoreKitKey` flag to `true` to use the same
private key as the Core Kit SDKs.
