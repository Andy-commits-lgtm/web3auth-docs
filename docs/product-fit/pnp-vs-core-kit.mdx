---

Plug and Play provide predefined UI & UX flows and easy-to-use SDKs, allowing developers to integrate Web3Auth instances quickly. Our PnP SDKs support
recovery when they lose access to their device, provided they have enabled MFA.

Core-Kit are built on top of the Web3Auth infrastructural layer allowing developers to define and develop their UX flows. They choose the Auth
provider and the factors to determine the key splitting. We also provide Core-Kit with one key using our SFA or Node SDKs. Developers could easily
switch projects starting with One-Key flow to PnP using a `useCoreKitKey: true` parameter in PnP Web SDKs.
