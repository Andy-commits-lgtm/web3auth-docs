Choosing the right Web3Auth product involves a careful analysis of what each option offers. Both our Plug and Play and Core-Kit solutions have unique
features and benefits tailored to meet specific project needs.

:::caution Pre Planning Product Requirements

This document helps you understand the differences between the products and helps you make the right choice for your project. This is a very important
step in the Web3Auth Integration process, please make sure you're making the right choice for your project. **We would recommend you to the SDKs in
the same stack of products within Web3Auth to minimize the migration efforts.**

If you're considering using the Core Kit Multi Factor SDKs in the future and want a quick integration to start off, we recommend you use the Single
Factor Auth SDKs right now and then move to the Multi Factor SDKs later. This will help you minimize the migration efforts from Plug and Play to Core
Kit.

In a case, where you have already integrated Web3Auth Plug and Play SDKs and want to move to Core Kit, we recommend you read our
[Troubleshooting Document around Key Migrations](/troubleshooting/different-private-key#migrating-between-sdks).
