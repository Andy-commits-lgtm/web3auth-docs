Web3Auth enables simple Web2 flows for Web3 onboarding. However, as good as that sounds, this process has a few moving parts for the developers to
understand and implement. The major reason behind this is to ensure that the user information are secure and they're in control of their keys. In all,
our goal is that the process is transparent to the users and developers and they can choose the best flows according to their needs. Before starting,
make sure you understand [how web3auth works](/how-web3auth-works), so that you can understand the different available flows mentioned here.

## Types of User Flows with Web3Auth

### One Click Login

This is the simplest flow for a user to onboard with Web3Auth. The user just needs to click on the login button, connect to their favourite social
account (OAuth) or any passwordless flow, like email passwordless, biometric authentication etc., and a private key is generated for them. This flow
has a 1/1 Key Share setup and the whole key via Web3Auth Auth Network key shares in the openlogin.com frontend. This flow is still non custodial since
the nodes in the Web3Auth network have a 5/9 consensus mechanism to generate the key shares.

However, one can claim that this flow is custodial to the OAuth Login provider, since this is directly generated using credentials provided by them.
**Hence we can call this flow a semi-custodial flow.**

- For Plug and Play SDKs, this flow can be achieved by setting the `MFALevel` to `'none'` within the Web3Auth Login while logging a user in.

- The Single Factor SDKs help you directly achieve this flow as well.

### Adding a Multi Factor Authentication

The Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This feature plays a key
role in the Key Infrastructure of Web3Auth and a developer needs to properly understand it to be able to onboard users safely and effectively. For
Core Kit SDKs, the developers can determine which flow suits them the most, but for Plug and Play, we have some predefined configurations that can be
used.

#### MFA Levels in Plug and Play SDKs

- **Default MFA:** During the first login, the user is onboarded using the one click login flow and allowed to experience the application. However, to
  eventually enhance security, they're prompted to create a backup share (recovery phrase) **every third login**, which is optional for the user to
  create.

  :::info

  This can be achieved by setting the `MFALevel` to `'default'` within the Web3Auth Login while logging a user in.

  :::

- **Optional MFA:** This is similar to the default MFA, except that the user is prompted to create a backup share at every login and is optional for
  them to create.

  :::info

  This can be achieved by setting the `MFALevel` to `'optional'` within the Web3Auth Login while logging a user in.

  :::

- **Mandatory MFA:** During the first login, the user is asked to create a backup share (recovery phrase) and it is a mandatory requirement for the
  user to create it.

  :::info

  This can be achieved by setting the `MFALevel` to `'mandatory'` within the Web3Auth Login while logging a user in.

## Web3Auth's Approach Towards User Onboarding

Web3Auth approaches user onboarding via **Progressive Discoverability**. This means that we are not forcing users to create a backup share right away.
Instead, we want them to be able to use the application in the traditional ways they're familiar with and once they're comfortable with the
application, we can then introduce the concept of Multi Factor Authentication to them. However, it highly depends on the dApps how they want to
approach this within their user flows. Below mentioned are the 4 pillars for Progressive Discoverability with Web3Auth:

### User Experience

This constitutes the user experience of the dApp. The dApp should be able to provide a seamless experience for the user to onboard. The focus here
includes:

1. Onboard with a single click
2. Provide a familiar Web2 user experience

### Accessibility

These are the different flows that the dApp can use to onboard users, according to the security and privacy needs of the dApp. There are multiple
types of flows like:

- **One click login** - only 1/1 Key Share required to login
- **Enhanced security login** - 2/3 Key Shares required to login
- **Types of Shares**

  - **Social Login Share** - Share attached with the user's social media account via the Web3Auth Auth Network. Please note that this share is also
    not custodial to any social network, rather the Web3Auth Network generates it with a 5/9 consensus mechanism.
  - **Trusted Device Share** - Share attached with the user's device. This share is stored within the browser local storage, or as a dApp Share within
    the particular application local context.
  - **Recovery Share** - Share attached with the user's recovery phrase. This share is generally shown the user while creating an MFA and the user has
    the flexibility to choose their own method for recovery. From social logins and passwordless to password based and manual key input, the user can
    choose any method to recover their account.

    :::info

    Please note that all these shares represent just 1/2 of the private key and on their own are not enough to login. However, the user can
    reconstruct them using Web3Auth, if they provide any 2 of these shares while logging in.

    :::

### Non Custodial

This is the major pillar that supports all the processes of Web3Auth. Being a totally non custodial solution, Web3Auth does not store any user data,
or any keys on its servers. This means that the user is in full control of their data and keys. This also means that the user can lose their account
if they are not able to provide the correct shares to reconstruct their private key. This is major information that the user needs to be made aware of
beyond the integrating application. A dApp can achieve this by:

- Making users aware about openlogin.com and how Web3Auth manages their keys.
- Making users aware about the different types of shares and how they can be used to reconstruct their private key.
- Making users aware about the importance of keeping their recovery phrase safe.
- Occasional check if the user has a recovery phrase or not.

### Interoperability

Interoperability, or the ability to use the same account across multiple applications, is a key feature of Web3Auth. This is achieved by the multiple
flows as mentioned in the [Interoperability](/pnp/features/interoperability) section of the documentation.
