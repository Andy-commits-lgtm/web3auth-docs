At Web3Auth, we understand the evolving landscape of the digital finance world and the increasing demand for bespoke digital wallet solutions. While
our SDKs allow developers to build their applications from scratch, we also understand the need for ready-to-go solutions. For businesses looking to
make their mark in the crypto space without building everything from the ground up, we present our **Enterprise WhiteLabelled Wallet**.

## WhiteLabelled Wallet Solutions

Our suite of products, including the **Torus Wallet**, **Web3Auth Plug and Play**, and **Web3Auth Core Kit**, all support whitelabeling as a feature
within the SDKs. However, for more intricate customizations and access to pre-constructed UI elements, our advanced offering can be your solution.

- **Torus Wallet**: Tailored to reflect your brand, leveraging the robust features of the Torus Wallet. Enables complete cloning of the website at
  [app.tor.us](app.tor.us).

- **Web3Auth Plug and Play**: Seamlessly integrate into your user experience. The entire flow can be cloned, replicating the functionality of
  [auth.web3auth.io](https://auth.web3auth.io).

- **React Native Whitelabeled Wallet**: A comprehensive solution optimized for mobile, guaranteeing a uniform and branded experience across all
  devices. A video demo of the wallet can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si8R2IVZHhM).

- **Custom UI/UX Flows**: Construct unique user pathways with our specialized assistance, ensuring a perfect alignment with your audience and
  objectives.
