For Near integration, Web3Auth offers an `ed25519` private key specifically tailored for the Solana
blockchain. This cryptographic key conforms to the standards required for secure authentication and
transaction signing on Solana's network.

Integrating Web3Auth with Solana is straightforward and efficient. Developers can leverage
Web3Auth's functionalities to establish secure connections with Solana nodes, enabling seamless
interaction with the blockchain. This includes tasks such as submitting transactions, querying
blockchain data, and managing user authentication within Solana-based applications.

With Web3Auth's native support for Near and the `ed25519` curve, developers can streamline their
development process and harness the full potential of blockchain technology within their Near-based
projects.

This documentation provides a straightforward guide for developers looking to implement Near
connection quickly and effortlessly across various platforms.
