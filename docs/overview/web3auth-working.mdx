This page covers the different aspect of what happens when you use Web3Auth. It is a good idea to read this before you start using Web3Auth. This
document will give you the user as well as the developer perspective on the architectural aspect of Web3Auth.

## User Onboarding Journey

---

For the developer, the integration is as simple as just initialising the Web3Auth SDKs and setting up the required configuration. The SDK is
integrated into either a website application or mobile/native app which embeds the login functionality. The developer can then use the SDK to
authenticate users by calling the connect function. This function can be triggered by a simple login button or by a user action.

##### On calling of the connect function,

- User is redirected to our portal (openlogin.com)
- Our portal, openlogin.com, then handles the initial process of login
- User is redirected to login/OAuth provider and carries out the auth process with respect to their auth provider
- User is redirected back to our portal, which then handles the reconstruction of the user’s key
- Finally, once the user is successfully authenticated, they are redirected back to application, with derived key specific to the application/wallet

##### Here's a diagram showing this process:

## High Level Architecture

---

Under the hood, Web3Auth's social logins are powered by the Torus Network's key infrastructure (tKey). Today's standard of key management is done via
seed phrases, 12 or 24 word representations of keys that can be written down or stored in various ways. While technically simple, its far from
perfect; new users take anywhere from 10-15 minutes more to onboard into any new application, losses are rapmant due to misplaced or compromised seed
phrases, today's standard leaves much to be desired.

With this architecture, users handle keys similar to a multi-factor account, where they use their OAuth login, devices and other factors to manage
their key pairs. The full cryptographic private keys of users are not recorded anywhere on the Torus Key Infrastructure system, even on any of our
database as well as participating nodes.

##### This diagram below, describes the relationship between the Web3Auth SDK and integrating application

As you can see, the SDK lives solely on the user/application’s front-end client and handles the interactions between OAuth providers, Auth Network,
and the Torus backend.

Once the user is redirected to the login flow within openlogin.com, tKey and the Auth Network are used to reconstruct the user’s key pair. tKey
leverages on variations of threshold key management to achieve a great user experience without sacrificing security, while retaining end-user autonomy
and control over the private key. tKey manages private keys using the user's device, private input, and/or OAuth authentication methods (i.e. Google,
Passwordless, Reddit) via Torus nodes. As long as a user has access to 2 out of 3 (2/3) of these shares, they will be able to retrieve their private
key.

##### This diagram below can help you understand how the keyshares are splitted and stored within different devices and the Auth Network:
