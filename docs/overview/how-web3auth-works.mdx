This page covers the different aspect of what happens when you use Web3Auth. It is a good idea to read this before you start using Web3Auth. This
document will give you the user as well as the developer perspective on the architectural aspect of Web3Auth.

## Replacing seedphrases with multi factor keys

---

Today's standard of key management is done via seed phrases, 12 or 24 word representations of keys that can be written down or stored in various ways.
While technically simple, its far from perfect; new users take anywhere from 10-15 minutes more to onboard into any new application, losses are
rapmant due to misplaced or compromised seed phrases, today's standard leaves much to be desired.

With Web3Auth, users handle keys similar to a multi-factor account, where they use their OAuth login, devices and other factors to manage their key
pairs. The full cryptographic private keys of users are not recorded anywhere on the Key Infrastructure system, even on any of our database as well as
participating nodes.

## High Level Architecture

---

The Web3Auth SDK lives solely on the user/application’s front-end client and handles the interactions between OAuth providers and the Auth Network.

:::note

As you can see, the integrated application or wallet ultimately ends up with a private key specific to their client ID. In this way, it is important
to note that **Web3Auth is not a Wallet, it is Wallet Infrastructure that is plugged into dApps or Wallets.**

:::

For the developer, the integration is as simple as just initialising the Web3Auth SDKs and setting up the required configuration. The SDK is
integrated into either a website application or mobile/native app which embeds the login functionality. The developer can then use the SDK to
authenticate users by calling the connect function. This function can be triggered by a simple login button or by a user action.

##### How Web3Auth interacts flow-wise with your wallet/application

Once the user starts the process, they:

1. User is redirected to our portal (openlogin.com)
2. Our portal, openlogin.com, then handles the initial process of login
3. User is redirected to login/OAuth provider and carries out the auth process with respect to their auth provider
4. User is redirected back to our portal, which then handles the reconstruction of the user’s key
5. Finally, once the user is successfully authenticated, they are redirected back to application, with derived key specific to the application/wallet
