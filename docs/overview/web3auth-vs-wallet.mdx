It is important to note that **Web3Auth is not a wallet, it is wallet infrastructure that is plugged into applications or wallets.** Web3Auth results
in a standard cryptographic key provider specific to the user and application. With Web3Auth, you're actually building an app with a wallet internally
or a wallet itself. This has advantages:

1. The application/wallet owns the whole experience, with minimal external branding. You're even able to use your own OAuth/ Single Sign On.
2. First time users don't need the mental overhead of understanding the concept of a "wallet" to use your application
3. With regards to, transaction screens you can manage that yourselves with a more seamless experience specific to your app

Building your own wallet comes with some hurdles though, linking this to other dapps/apps is a bit harder. We have some solutions that help along the
way, such as natively integrated wallet connect or the `torus-ui-plugin` - but in general intreopability is harder.
