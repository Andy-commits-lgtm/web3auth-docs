title: Layer2s and other EVM chain support
---

Wallet supports Ethereum L2s or more specifically any chain that is an EVm chain (and interacts via JRPC). We support several chains by default (BSC,
Matic/Polygon, SKALE and others\) and using them simply require you to change the JRPC endpoint for your Ethereum Node. The defaults and how to change
them can be found here - [available network list](../developing-with-wallet/networklist).

Even if your chain that you're looking to develop isnt a default, its possible add a custom network and even toggle the default currency. More in our
[API reference](/wallet/api-reference/class).
