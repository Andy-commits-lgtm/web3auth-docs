# Backup Share for Mobile - dApp Share

## Web3Auth Infrastructure at a glance

If you go through the [Web3Auth infrastructure](/overview/key-management/) you'll notice that to enable the non custodiality of Web3Auth, we split the
private key into multiple parts, ie. `shares`. These shares are a part of the off chain multisig, where multiple shares are stored in different places
and can be used to reconstruct the private key dynamically in the user's frontend application. For a glance at the structure of the shares, these are
the following:

1. **`ShareA` is stored on the user's device**: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be
   stored in device storage secured via biometrics.
2. **`ShareB` is managed by a login service via node operators**: This share is further split amongst a network of nodes and retrieved via
   conventional authentication flows.
3. **`ShareC` is a recovery share**: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
   enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key. This
initial setup provides several benefits.

## The User Experience in Mobile Platforms

The user experience in mobile platforms is very different from the web platforms. This is because the user has to be redirected to a browser where
they can login using their socials and then back to the app once they have been successfully authenticated. This user experience shifts the context
between two applications, whereas in the web platforms, the context remains within the browser only.

For the seemless login flow, we need to reconstruct the Shares `A` and `B`. `Share B` is managed by the login service and is provided on successful
authentication. Whereas in web platforms, `Share A` is stored in the browser context. We can still store it in the browser context for mobile devices,
but this has a few risks, like user accidently deleting browser data. This is a bigger problem in mobile devices since the user doesn't realise that
the browser is being used to login within the app and clearing the browser data can cause their logins to fail. Hence, to tackle this issue, Web3Auth
issues a dApp Share, ie. a backup share that can be stored by the app developer directly within their application and used to reconstruct the private
key after successful login by the user.

## The dApp Share

After a successful login from a user, the user details are returned as a response to the application in mobile devices. This same response can be
gathered in web applications using the `getUserInfo()` function as well. The login response for different platforms looks as follows:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="android"
  values={[
    { label: "Web", value: "web" },
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
    { label: "React Native", value: "react-native" },
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter" },
  ]}

<TabItem value="web">

<WebResponse />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" >

<AndroidResponse />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ios" >

<IosResponse />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="react-native">

<RNResponse />

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="flutter">

<FlutterResponse />

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you notice, in all these reponses there's a field called `dappShare` which is a 24 words seed phrase that can be used to reconstruct the private
key. This dappShare is a suplement to the `Share A` and represents half of the private key. The application can store the dApp share in their own
application local storage safely.

Now, while logging in the user can use their social accounts to obtain one share, and the application provides the dApp Share, removing the need to
store the share in the browser context and enabling user to login seemlessly. This can be done by passing over the stored dApp share value in the
login function (for Mobile SDKs) or the openlogin adapter configuration (for Web SDK).

You can read more about how to use dApp Share for your platform in the particular [SDK Reference](/sdk).

:::note

One major thing to note here is that the `dappShare` is only available for custom verifiers and not the standard web3auth verifiers. This is done to
make sure that an application only has access to the corresponding share to the private key of their application's user. Hence, to use dApp Share, one
has to use the custom authentication feature of Web3Auth.
