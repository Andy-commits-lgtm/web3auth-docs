At Web3Auth, we prioritize your security by offering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is an extra layer of protection that verifies your
identity when accessing your account. To ensure ownership, you must provide two or more different backup factors. You have the option to choose from
the device, social, backup factor (seed phrase), and password factors to guarantee access to your Web3 account. Once you create a recovery factor, MFA
is enabled, and your keys are divided into three shares for off-chain multi-sig, making the key self-custodial. Without MFA, the keys are not divided,
which increases the risk of losing them as users might accidentally clear their browser's local storage. With backup factors, you can easily recover
your account if you lose access to your original device or helps login into a new device.

For a dApp, we provide various options to set up Multi-Factor Authentication. You can customize the MFA screen by setting the `mfaLevel` argument. You
can enable or disable a backup factor and change their order. Currently, there are four values for `mfaLevel`:

- `default`: presents the MFA screen every third login
- `optional`: presents the MFA screen on every login, but you can skip it
- `mandatory`: make it mandatory to set up MFA after login
- `none`: skips the MFA setup screen

We offer the following backup factors under `mfaSettings`:

- `deviceShareFactor`,
- `backUpShareFactor`,
- `socialBackupFactor`, and
- `passwordFactor`.

Choose the best options that suit your needs to ensure a safe and secure Web3 experience.
