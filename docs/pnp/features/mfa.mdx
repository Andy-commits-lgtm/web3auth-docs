The Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). Once a recovery phrase is
created, the user keys are divided into 3 shares enabling the off-chain multisig functionality, making the key further self custodial for the user.
Without an MFA, this is not enabled to make sure the user doesn't lose the keys by accidently clearing their browser local storage. A backup share
helps a user to login into a new device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

For a dApp, we give a variety of choices to set the multi factor authentication for the user. You can set the `mfaLevel` argument to customize when
MFA screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`'default'`** Setting mfa level to `default` will present mfa screen to user on every third login.
- **`'optional'`** Setting mfa level to `optional` will present mfa screen to user on every login but user can skip it.
- **`'mandatory'`** Setting mfa level to `mandatory` will make it mandatory for user to setup mfa after login.
- **`'none'`** Setting mfa level to `none` will make the user skip the mfa setup screen
