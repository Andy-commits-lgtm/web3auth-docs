# Whitelabeling your Web3Auth Integration

---

Whitelabeling gives you the ability to have a consistent user experience throughout your application. Web3Auth allows you to define a custom UI,
branding, and translations for your applications. All our SDKs support Whitelabeling, giving granular customisation capability across all our
offerings.

You can do whitelabelling across `Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal`, `Openlogin Adapter`, and `Torus Wallet Adapter` instances.

- [Web3Auth Plug and Play Modal](/whitelabel/login-modal)
- [Openlogin Adapter](/whitelabel/user-flow-screens)
- [Torus Wallet Adapter](/whitelabel/torus-wallet-plugin)
