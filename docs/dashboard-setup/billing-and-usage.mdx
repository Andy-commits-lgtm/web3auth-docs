### How do we calculate Monthly Active Wallets(MAW)?

MAW refers to the total number of unique logins made into your user account, as part of your wallet. MAWs identify the total number of unique wallets
that have logged into a new session or have performed a new transaction from your dApp at least once. The terms being - a maximum of 5 logins or
transactions within one month (30 days).

$$

Total \ MAWs = \underline{Total \ logins / \ \overbrace{transaction \ signs}^{\text{(only for MPC Integrations)}}\  \ per \ unique \ wallet }\\ \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space 5


$$

- For example, under Growth Plan, $0.03 is charged per additional MAW.
- If a unique wallet does 17 logins/transactions, this is counted as 4 MAWs (17/5=4 ~ round up to whole number).
