# Client ID and Whitelisting references

### How to whitelist URLs without using the Developer Dashboard?

You can use the manual origin whitelisting method to whitelist URLs without using the Developer Dashboard. `OpenLoginAdapter` accepts a parameter
called `originData` inside the `adapterSettings`. `originData` is a key value pair where key is the origin URL and the value is a `signature`. The
signature is generated by `whitelistUrl` function from the `@toruslabs/openlogin` package. The `whitelistUrl` function accepts the `clientId`,
`clientSecret` and `origin` as parameters.

```js
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
import { whitelistUrl } from "@toruslabs/openlogin";
import { CommonPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/base-provider";

const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"; // get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io
const clientSecret = "CORRESPONDING_CLIENT_SECRET"; // get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io
const origin = "https://example.com";

const privateKeyProvider = new CommonPrivateKeyProvider({ config: { chainConfig } });
const sig = await whitelistUrl(clientId, clientSecret, origin);

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  privateKeyProvider,
  adapterSettings: {
    originData: { origin: sig },
  },
});
```

A snippet from the SDK reference for `originData` is given below:
```ts
    /**
     * originData is used to verify the origin of dapp by iframe.
     *
     * @internal
     * @remarks
     * You don't have to pass originData explicitly if you have registered your dapp at
     * {@link "https://dashboard.web3auth.io"| developer dashboard}.
     *
     * originData contains a signature of dapp's origin url which is generated using
     * project's secret.
     */
    originData?: OriginData;
```

### How to secure the backlinking via whitelusting strategies to avoid phishing attacks?

Deep links are a type of link that can direct users deeper into a native mobile application. These are useful for connecting users to specific content
within apps, but they don't have built-in mechanisms for verifying the authenticity of the destination app. This can potentially expose users to
phishing attacks if they are directed to a malicious app instead.

On the other hand, Android's App Links and iOS's Universal Links (similar in purpose to App Links) are a more secure version of deep links. They
include a verification process that Android and iOS use to confirm the link's destination. In the case of App Links, Android checks the app's digital
asset links file hosted on the website's server, which contains information that links the website's URL to the app. This information must also be
included in the app's manifest file. This process ensures that the app associated with the website is the legitimate destination, thereby mitigating
the risk of phishing by not allowing malicious apps to intercept these links.

All OAuth applications work on whitelisting strategies. One may use App links or Universal links to secure the backlinking via whitelisting instead of
deep links.
