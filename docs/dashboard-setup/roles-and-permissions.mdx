In order to perform any actions on the Web3Auth dashboard, such as collaborating on a project or adjusting your team's billing settings, you must have
the necessary access permissions. Permissions determine a user's ability to perform specific actions, such as editing project settings or accessing
billing information. To manage these permissions, you can assign roles to team members. A role is a predefined set of permissions assigned to one or
more users. By assigning the appropriate roles to team members, you can ensure they have access to perform their tasks effectively while maintaining
security and control over your Web3Auth projects.

## Create a team

---

To create a team in the Web3Auth dashboard, you need to be logged in and click on your profile image under the "Workspace" section in the sidebar.
From there, you can see the list of teams you're currently part of and a button to create a new team. Click on the button, enter the name of your new
team, and then click the "Create Team" button to complete the process.

## Team Roles

---

- **Owner**: The only people on your team who can add new members and edit settings or delete a team. If you create a workspace, you're automatically
  an owner. Ownership may be transferable and there may only be one owner at one time.

- **Admin**: People on your team who can create, edit, move projects and settings in the team, but not delete the team.

- **Member**: People on your team who can only view the projects but not edit any projects or settings

- **Billing**: Member who can only manage the billing settings of your team. There may only be one billing role at one time.

## Invite members to team

---

To invite members to your team, you must be an owner of the team. To invite a member, click on the team name in the sidebar and then click on the
"Invite" button. You can invite members by email address. If the member is already a user of Web3Auth, they will receive an email with a link to join
your team. If the member is not a user of Web3Auth, they will receive an email with a link to create an account and join your team.

## Seats and billing

---

Web3Auth's base plan is available only for individuals. If you are a team of 2 or more, you will need to upgrade to growth plan and above.

- The Web3Auth dashboard allows you to easily add new members to your team. To add members, simply navigate to the "Team" section of the dashboard and
  click the "Add Member" button. From here, you can enter the email address of the person you wish to add, along with their name and the role you want
  to assign them.

- Once you have added a member to your team, they will receive an email inviting them to join. They will need to log in to the Web3Auth dashboard
  using their existing account or create a new account to accept the invitation.

- It's important to note that there is a five-minute link expiry for the invitation email. If the link expires, the member will need to request a new
  invitation.

- After accepting the invitation, the new member will have access to the Web3Auth dashboard with the permissions assigned to their role. It's
  important to review and manage these permissions to ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access.

- If a member's role requires approval from another member, they will receive an email asking for approval before they can access the dashboard. It's
  important to keep track of pending invitations and approvals to ensure that team members can access the dashboard as needed.

- Lastly, it's important to keep track of your team's seats and billing. Each team member requires a seat, and you may need to adjust your billing
  settings if you exceed your plan's limits. You can view and manage your team's billing information in the "Billing" section of the dashboard.
