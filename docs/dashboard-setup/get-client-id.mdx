In order to obtain a Client ID, you must create a new Plug and Play project within the Web3Auth dashboard. The term "Plug and Play" refers to the
pre-built user interface and user experience that Web3Auth offers for integration with your project. This feature allows for easy and efficient
integration of Web3Auth, eliminating the need to design the entire process from scratch. Using the Plug and Play project option, you can seamlessly
integrate Web3Auth into your project and obtain a Client ID quickly.

The Plug and Play Project's dashboard page will look something like this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={DashboardPnP} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Plug and Play Projects" />
</div>
<br />

<div style={{ display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "10px" }}>
  <div style={{ flexBasis: "30%", flexGrow: "10", justifyContent: "center" }}>
    Here, we've already created a project called <strong>"Test Project"</strong>.
    <br />
    <br />
    To create a new project, navigate to the "Create Project" tab on the right-hand side of the screen. Here, you will find a toggle that allows you to
    enter your Project Name, choose an environment, and select the blockchain you wish to integrate with. Depending on your requirements, there are various
    production environment options available to choose from. Follow the prompts and enter the necessary information to create your new project quickly.

    Available Web3Auth Networks:
    <ul>
      <li><b>testnet</b></li>
      <li><b>mainnet</b></li>
      <li><b>cyan</b>:  Mainnet</li>
      <li><b>aqua</b>: Mainnet</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div
    style={{
      flexBasis: "40%",
      flexGrow: "1",
      alignItems: "center",
      justifyContent: "center",
    }}
  >
    <img style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "500px", alignSelf: "center" }} src={DashboardPnpCreate} alt="Dashbaord PnP Project Create" />
  </div>

## Diving into a Web3Auth project

A project contains the following:

### Client ID

The Project ID is a distinctive identifier for your project and is used to identify your project within the Web3Auth dashboard. You will need this ID
when initializing the Web3Auth SDK within your application. Once you create a project, the Project ID is automatically generated for you. It is
important to copy and include this value in your initialization code to ensure seamless integration with Web3Auth.

### Client Secret

The Project Secret Key is a confidential code utilized to verify your project's authenticity. Like the Project ID, the Secret Key is also generated
automatically upon project creation.

### Add a new whitelist URL

The Whitelist URL is the address you wish to authorize for your project. When implementing Web3Auth, it is important to whitelist the specific URLs
from which you intend to make calls for user authentication. By doing so, you can ensure that these activities are conducted securely and efficiently.
Remember to whitelist all relevant URLs to guarantee seamless integration with Web3Auth.
