card to your account, and view your invoices. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the financial aspect of your Web3Auth integration,
allowing you to stay informed and in control of your project's expenditures.

### How we calucalte MAW?

- 1 Monthly Active Wallet (MAW) = 5 logins/transactions^ per unique wallet per month (^MPC integration)
- Formula: Total logins/transactions divided by 5 = Total MAWs
- For example, under Growth Plan, $0.03 is charged per additional MAW.
- If a unique wallet does 17 logins/transactions, this is counted as 4 MAWs (17/5=4 ~ round up to whole number).
