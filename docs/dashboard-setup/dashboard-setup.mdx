The Web3Auth dashboard summarizes various aspects of Web3Auth, including information about projects, verifiers, billings, and profile setup. Using
this dashboard lets users get an overview of their Web3Auth-related activities and can easily collaborate with others to build better applications.
Since collaboration is essential for creating successful apps, the Web3Auth dashboard helps users work together more effectively.
