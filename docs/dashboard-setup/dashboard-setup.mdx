The Web3Auth dashboard provides a summary of various aspects related to Web3Auth, including information about projects, verifiers, billings, and team
setup. Using this dashboard lets users get an overview of their Web3Auth-related activities and can easily collaborate with others to build better
applications. Since collaboration is essential for creating successful apps, the Web3Auth dashboard helps users work together more effectively.

## Getting Started

---

To begin using the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/), simply log in using one of your social accounts. Please be aware that the
login process utilizes the Web3Auth interface with a customized user interface to generate a wallet for you. Your users will experience a similar flow
when using your application integrated with Web3Auth. This ensures a seamless and secure authentication process for your users.
