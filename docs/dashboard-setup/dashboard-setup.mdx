The Web3Auth dashboard summarizes various aspects of Web3Auth, including information about projects, verifiers, billings, and profile setup. Using
this dashboard lets users get an overview of their Web3Auth-related activities and can easily collaborate with others to build better applications.
Since collaboration is essential for creating successful apps, the Web3Auth dashboard helps users work together more effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin using the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), log in using one of your social accounts or use your email address. Please be
aware that the login process utilizes the Web3Auth infrastructure with a customized user interface to generate a wallet for you.

your projects and billing.

## Billing

Welcome to the Billing section of your dashboard. Here, you can easily access and view all your billing details, attach a card to your account, and
view your invoices.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={DashboardBilling} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Billing Teams" />
</div>
<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>

  <img src={DashboardBillingPayment} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Dashboard Billing Teams Choice of Plans" />
</div>

## Migration of Verifiers

Users can now attach old verifiers to projects with a one-time process from the verifier tab in our new dashboard.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={MigrateVerifiers} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Migrate Verifiers to a Project." />
</div>

**To move the verifiers to a project, follow the steps below:**

1. Click on the three dots located on the verifier that you want to move.
2. Select "Move to project".
3. Choose the project(s) where you want to move the verifier.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={VerifierToMigrate} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Verifier to Migrate." />
</div>
<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={VerifierAfterMigration} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Verifier after Migrating to a project." />
</div>

In case you don't see the **"Move to project"** option, the verifier needs to be moved to a new project with the same environment as the verifier.
Once the verifier is moved, you will see the projects it has been moved into under the "Projects" column.

The verifiers will remain in the verifier tab until **October 31st, 2023**. However, **move your verifiers into a project before this date** to avoid
any issues. If you fail to do so, and the verifiers are not linked to any project, they **will be deleted** from the dashboard. This could cause
problems for any projects that use these verifiers. Therefore, it's essential that you move all your verifiers to their respective projects before the
deadline.

Finally, remember that you can attach the same verifier to multiple projects if needed.
