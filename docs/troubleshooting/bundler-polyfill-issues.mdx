While setting up a new web3 project from scratch, in frameworks like Vite, Svelte, or Rollup, you may encounter issues with the Bundler polyfills.
This is because these frameworks do not include the Bundler polyfills by default and you may run into issues building these apps. Hence, you require
certain bundler polyfills to be added to your project, while overriding the configurations to enable their usage.

### Vite

#### Solution

- Install the missing modules

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill rollup-plugin-node-polyfills rollup-plugin-node-builtins buffer process
```

Add the following lines to `vite.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill";
import rollupNodePolyFill from "rollup-plugin-node-polyfills";
import builtins from "rollup-plugin-node-builtins";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // This Rollup aliases are extracted from @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill,
      // see https://github.com/remorses/esbuild-plugins/blob/master/node-modules-polyfill/src/polyfills.ts

      plugins: [
        // Enable rollup polyfills plugin
        // used during production bundling
        builtins(),
        rollupNodePolyFill(),
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

Even after adding this you might face issues like an empty modal popping up. The empty modal just pops up locally, it happens due to caching issues.
You can remove the `React.StrictMode` from your `index.js` file to fix this issue.

The empty modal doesn't appear in production builds.
