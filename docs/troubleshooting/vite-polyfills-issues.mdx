While setting up a new vite project from scratch, you may encounter issues with the Vite polyfills. This is because these frameworks do not include
the Vite polyfills by default and you may run into issues building these apps. Hence, you require certain vite polyfills to be added to your project,
while overriding the configurations to enable their usage.

### Vite

##### Solution

- Install the missing modules

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill rollup-plugin-node-polyfills rollup-plugin-node-builtins buffer process
```

- Update the `vite.config.js` to refer the polyfill modules we installed.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill";
import rollupNodePolyFill from "rollup-plugin-node-polyfills";
import builtins from "rollup-plugin-node-builtins";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // This Rollup aliases are extracted from @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill,
      // see https://github.com/remorses/esbuild-plugins/blob/master/node-modules-polyfill/src/polyfills.ts

  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      target: "es2020",
      supported: { bigint: true },
      plugins: [NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin()],
    },
  },
  build: {
    target: "es2020",
    rollupOptions: {
      plugins: [
        // Enable rollup polyfills plugin
        // used during production bundling
        builtins(),
        rollupNodePolyFill(),
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

- Update the `index.html` file to include the polyfills. As shown in the code snippet below we added the `<script>` tag to include the polyfills.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Add the following lines -->
    <script type="module">
      import { Buffer } from "buffer";
      import process from "process";
      window.Buffer = Buffer;
      window.process = process;
    </script>
    <!----------------------------->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::caution

Even after adding this you might face issues like an empty modal popping up. The empty modal just pops up locally, it happens due to caching issues.
You can remove the `React.StrictMode` from your `index.js` file to fix this issue.

The empty modal doesn't appear in production builds.
