While setting up a new web3 project from scratch, you might face multiple issues with Vite configuration. This issue is caused due to the fact that
the `web3.js` and `ethers.js` packages have certain dependencies, which are not present within the browser environment by Vite. Hence, you require
certain node polyfills to be added to your project, while overriding the configurations to enable their usage. When that is done, your project should
be able to utilise the `web3.js` and `ethers.js` packages easily without any issues.

In this guide, we have added instructions of adding the polyfills in Vite:

#### Solution

- Install the missing modules

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill rollup-plugin-node-polyfills rollup-plugin-node-builtins buffer process
```

- Update the `vite.config.js` to refer the polyfill modules we installed.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin } from "@esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill";
import rollupNodePolyFill from "rollup-plugin-node-polyfills";
import builtins from "rollup-plugin-node-builtins";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      // This Rollup aliases are extracted from @esbuild-plugins/node-modules-polyfill,
      // see https://github.com/remorses/esbuild-plugins/blob/master/node-modules-polyfill/src/polyfills.ts

    },
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      target: "es2020",
      supported: { bigint: true },
      plugins: [NodeModulesPolyfillPlugin()],
    },
  },
  build: {
    target: "es2020",
    rollupOptions: {
      plugins: [
        // Enable rollup polyfills plugin
        // used during production bundling
        builtins(),
        rollupNodePolyFill(),
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

- Update the `index.html` file to include the polyfills. As shown in the code snippet below we added the `<script>` tag to include the polyfills.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!--highlight-start-->
    <script type="module">
      import { Buffer } from "buffer";
      import process from "process";
      window.Buffer = Buffer;
      window.process = process;
    </script>
    <!--highlight-end-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::caution

Even after adding this you might face issues like an empty modal popping up. The empty modal just pops up locally, it happens due to caching issues.
You can remove the `React.StrictMode` from your `index.js` file to fix this issue.

The empty modal doesn't appear in production builds.
