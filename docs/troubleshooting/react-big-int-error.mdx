While creating a production build for your React app and hosting it, you might encounter the following error:

> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number

This error is caused by the fact that the production build of React is not specified the versions of the browsers. This can be solved by adding the
following lines to the `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
"browserslist": {
    "production": [
      "chrome >= 67",
      "edge >= 79",
      "firefox >= 68",
      "opera >= 54",
      "safari >= 14"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
```

After adding the above lines, create the production build again and you should be good to go.
