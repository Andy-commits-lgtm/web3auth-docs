Web3Auth's Key Management Infrastructure is designed to enhance security and privacy while managing cryptographic keys in the web3 ecosystem. It
achieves this by distributing a user's private key across multiple key shares, forming a 'web of trust' that enables multi-factor account handling.
The system leverages Threshold Cryptography principles, where a user only needs a minimum of 2 out of n key shares to access their private key or
generate transaction signatures.

One of the key advantages of this infrastructure is that it eliminates the need to store complete private keys anywhere, including databases and
participating nodes. Instead, the private key is distributed across the network in a non-custodial manner, reducing the risk of a single point of
failure and preventing potential losses due to device theft or loss.

As cryptographic applications become more prevalent, the importance of proper key management grows as well. Mismanagement of private keys can lead to
financial losses, making secure and efficient key management crucial. Web3Auth's non-custodial key management infrastructure, powered by MPC
(Multi-Party Computation), addresses these challenges.

The design goals of Web3Auth's key management infrastructure include:

- Seamless non-custodial key management user experiences.
- Compatibility with existing authentication methods and blockchain ecosystems.
- Global performance and scalability to meet the demands of the Web3 market.

## Overview

In a typical 2 out of 3 (2/3) setup, the user is provided with three factors: OAuth Login Factor, Device Factor, and Backup/ 2FA Factor. Please note
that the threshold can increase for more security. It is dependent on the intergating application.

- **OAuth Login Factor** is managed and divided across Web3Auth's Auth Network and can be accessed through an OAuth login provider owned by the user,
  like their Google account.
- **Device Factor** is stored on the user's device. The method of storage is specific to the device and system. For instance, on mobile devices, the
  factor could be stored in device storage that's secured with biometrics.
- **Backup/ 2FA Factor** serves as a recovery share. It's an extra factor that the user can keep on a separate device, download, or base on user input
  with sufficient entropy. This could include a password, security questions, or a hardware device, among other options.

Out of these, the OAuth Login Factor is the most important factor. The Web3Auth Key Management Infrastructure is designed to ensure that the OAuth
Login Factor is properly secured and distributed across the Web3Auth Auth Network, where key generation operates via a 5/9 consensus system. This
ensures that keys remain non-custodial, meaning neither Web3Auth, Social Login Providers, nor any other party holding a key share can claim full
ownership.

Before diving further into the infrastructure, let's first understand the key terms used in the infrastructure.

### Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS)

Shamir’s secret sharing scheme is a polynomial threshold $[(t,n)]$ secret sharing scheme where a dealer divides a secret into n multiple shares and
each participant is given a share by evaluating a polynomial of order $t$ . To reconstruct the secret, $t + 1$ shares are required.

SSS is a base fundemental in a lot of MPC cryptography and in Web3Auth’s infrastucture. More can be read
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing).

### Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)

Verifiable secret sharing refers to Shamir secret sharing schemes where even in the presence of malicious dealers, there is a well-defined secret that
the participants can later reconstruct.

### Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

Distributed key generation was introduced by Pedersen, and the key idea involves using n parallel runs of SSS or VSS to ensure that there is no dealer
who knows the secret. We generally use a varient of [Async Verifiable Secret Sharing](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/134.pdf) in our DKG.

### Proactive Secret Sharing (PSS)

Proactive secret sharing allows participants to “refresh” shares, so that all participants receive new shares, but the secret remains unchanged. This
allows the secret sharing to be secure against mobile adversaries who may be able to compromise all participants over the lifetime of the secret (eg.
adversary hacks a random participant’s server every month). We refer the user to a
[Proactive Secret Sharing Scheme](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/134.pdf) that supports dynamic sets of participants, which we use for share refresh.

### Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)

Threshold signature schemes refer to signing schemes that allow a qualified set of parties involved in a secret sharing scheme to generate a signature
on a message without reconstructing the private key. The most well-known signature scheme is [GG19](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114.pdf) and an
implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/multi-party-ecdsa). In particular Web3Auth supports and utilizes GG19, GG20, its EDDSA
variants, and DKLS19.
